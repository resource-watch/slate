# Widget

## What is a widget?

In a nutshell, a RW API widget is a toolset to help you render your data in a visually more appealing way. The [widget concept documentation](#widget) will give you a more detailed description of this, and we encourage you to read it before proceeding. We also recommend you take a look at our section about [Vega](#widget-configuration-using-vega-grammar) if you plan on reusing existing widgets or uploading widgets that are reusable by other users. The RW API does not require you to use Vega, but we highly recommend that you do, as it's the technology used by many of the widgets you'll find on the RW API.

This endpoint allows you to list existing widgets and their properties. The result is a paginated list of 10 widgets, followed by metadata on total number of widgets and pages, as well as useful pagination links. By default, only widgets with `env` value `production` are displayed. In the sections below, weâ€™ll explore how you can customize this endpoint call to match your needs.


### Getting all widgets for a dataset

> Return the widgets associated with a dataset


```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget"

When handling widgets, it's common to want to limit results to those widgets associated with a given dataset. Besides the [filters](#filters135) covered below, there's an additional convenience endpoint to get the widgets associated with a dataset, as shown in this example. 

### Getting all widgets for multiple datasets

> Return all widgets associated with two datasets

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/widget/find-by-ids" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
	"ids": ["<dataset 1 id>", "<dataset 2 id>"]
}'
```

> Example response:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "73f00267-fe34-42aa-a611-13b102f38d75",
            "type": "widget",
            "attributes": {
                "name": "Precipitation Change in Puget Sound",
                "dataset": "06c44f9a-aae7-401e-874c-de13b7764959",
                "slug": "precipitation-change",
                "userId": "58333dcfd9f39b189ca44c75",
                "description": "NOAA nCLIMDIV Precipitation: Historical Precipitation",
                "source": null,
                "sourceUrl": null,
                "authors": null,
                "application": [
                    "prep"
                ],
                "verified": false,
                "default": true,
                "protected": false,
                "defaultEditableWidget": false,
                "published": true,
                "freeze": false,
                "env": "production",
                "queryUrl": "query/06c44f9a-aae7-401e-874c-de13b7764959?sql=select annual as x, year as y from index_06c44f9aaae7401e874cde13b7764959%20order%20by%20year%20asc",
                "widgetConfig": {...}
            }
        },
        {...}
    ]
}
```

This endpoint allows authenticated users to load all widgets belonging to multiple datasets in a single request. 

> Return all widgets associated with two datasets, that are associated with either `rw` or `prep` applications 

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/widget/find-by-ids" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
	"ids": ["<dataset 1 id>", "<dataset 2 id>"],
    "app" "rw,prep"
}'
```

> Return all widgets associated with two datasets, that are associated with both `rw` and `prep` applications simultaneously 

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/widget/find-by-ids" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
	"ids": ["<dataset 1 id>", "<dataset 2 id>"],
    "app" "rw@prep"
}'
```

Besides the required `ids` array, your request body may optionally include a `app` string value if you'd like to filter the returned widgets by their `application`:

- Use a single value, like `rw`, if you want to show only widgets that have `rw` as one of their applications. 
- Use a comma separated list, like `rw,prep`, if you want to show only widgets that have `rw` or `prep` as one of their applications.
- Use a @ separated list, like `rw@prep`, if you want to show only widgets that have both `rw` and `prep` as their applications.
- None of the filters require exact matching - a widget that simultaneously contain the applications `rw`, `prep` and `gfw` would match all 3 filters above.

Please note that, unlike [getting all widgets](#getting-all-widgets) or [getting all widgets for a dataset](#getting-all-widgets-for-a-dataset), this endpoint does not come with paginated results, nor does it support [pagination](#pagination134), [filtering](#filters135) or [sorting](#sorting136) or [including related entities](#include-related-entities137) described in their respective sections.


### Pagination

By default, widgets are listed in pages of 10 widgets each, and the first page is loaded. However, you can customize this behavior using the following query parameters:  

> Custom pagination: load page 2 using 25 results per page

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?page[number]=2&page[size]=25"
```

Field        |         Description          |   Type |   Default
------------ | :--------------------------: | -----: | ----------:
page[size]   | The number elements per page. Values above 100 are not officially supported. | Number | 10
page[number] |       The page number        | Number | 1

### Filters

> Return the widgets filtered by those whose name contains emissions

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?name=emissions"
```

> Return the widgets filtered by dataset

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?dataset=11de2bc1-368b-42ed-a207-aaff8ece752b"
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/11de2bc1-368b-42ed-a207-aaff8ece752b/widget"
```

> Filter widgets by default value

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?default=false"
```

> Filter widgets by environment


```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?env=staging"
```

> Return the widgets filtered by those whose applications contain both `rw` and `prep` applications simultaneously

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?app=rw@prep"
```

The widget list endpoints provide a wide range of filters that you can use to tailor your widget listing. The great majority of the widget fields you'll find on the [widget reference](#widget-reference) section can be used as filters when listing widgets, with the following exceptions:

- `id`
- `userName`
- `userRole`: filtering by the role of the owning user can be done using the `user.role` query argument.

Additionally, you can use the following filters:

- `collection`: filters by a [collection](#collections) id. Requires being authenticated.
- `favourite`: if defined, only the widgets set by the user as [favorites](#favorites) will be returned. Requires being authenticated.

Multiple parameters can be combined into a complex `and` logic filter. Depending on the type of the field you're filtering by, the following behavior is available:

- String type fields support both regular expressions and partial matches.
- Array type fields support `,` as `OR` and `@` as `AND` separators for multiple values.
- Object type fields will match the whole object, not just its parts.

### Sorting

The API currently supports sorting by means of the `sort` parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the widget, as well as `user.name` and `user.role` (sorting by user data is restricted to `ADMIN` users).

Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.

> Sorting widgets

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name"
```

Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.


> Sorting widgets by multiple criteria

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name,slug"
```

You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either `-` or `+`. By default, `asc` order is assumed.

> Explicit order of sorting

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=-name,+slug"
```

> Sorting widgets by the role of the user who owns the widget

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=user.role"
```

### Include related entities

When loading widget data, you can optionally pass an `includes` query argument to load additional data.

#### Vocabulary

Loads related vocabularies. If none are found, an empty array is returned.

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?includes=vocabulary"
```

Loads the name and email address of the author of the widget. If the user issuing the request has role `ADMIN`, the response will also display the role of the widget's author. If the data is not available (for example, the user has since been deleted), no `user` property will be added to the widget object.

## Creating a widget

To create a widget, you need to define all of the required fields in the request body. The fields that compose a widget are:

Field        |               Description               |    Type |                                          Values | Required
------------ | :-------------------------------------: | ------: | ----------------------------------------------: | -------:

It is possible to create a widget that has a different `env` property to its parent dataset.

> To create a widget, you have to do a POST request with the following body:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "widget": {
      "application":[
         "your", "apps"
      ],
      "name":"Example Widget"
      "published": true
   }
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Creating a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.

A user with role `USER` can update their own widgets, based on the `userId` field. A user with `ADMIN` role can update any widget.

> To update a widget, you have to do a PATCH request with the following body:

```shell
curl -X PATCH "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "widget": {
      "application":[
         "your", "apps"
      ],
      "name":"New Example Widget Name",
      "widgetConfig": {}
   }
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Updating a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.
</aside>


## Cloning a widget

You can clone an existing widget as long as you have permissions to the applications associated with it. Basic usage requires no body params, but you can optionally pass a new `name` or `description` to be used in the creation of the new widget.


> To clone a widget, you should use one of the following POST requests:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>/clone" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

> You can optionally set a new name or description:


```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "name": "name for the cloned widget",
   "description": "
   "name": "name for the cloned widget", for the cloned widget",
}'
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>/clone" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "name": "name for the cloned widget",
   "description": "
   "name": "name for the cloned widget", for the cloned widget",
}'
```

### Cloning widgets from other microservices

When cloning a widget, the newly created clone will take the `userId` of the originating request. If you call this endpoint as an authenticated user from your custom application, that means it will get that authenticated user's `userId`. However, if invoked from another API microservice, that `userId` is no longer available. In this scenario, when the request to clone is originated internally, you can optionally pass a `userÃŒd` body value that will be set as the `userId` of the newly created widget.

<aside class="warning">
User IDs provided this way are not validated.
</aside>

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <microservice-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "userId": "123456789",
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Cloning a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.
</aside>


## Deleting a widget

Who can delete Widgets?

- Users with the `MANAGER` role who are in the same app as the widget and are in the widget's `userId`
- Users with the `ADMIN` role who are in the same app as the widget.

<aside class="notice">
   The endpoints `/widget/:widget` and `/dataset/:dataset/widget/:widget` perform the same action, with the only difference being that the latter checks if the dataset exists before deleting the widget.
</aside>

```shell
curl -X DELETE "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```


## Widget reference

This section gives you a complete view at the properties that are maintained as part of widget. When interacting with a widget (on get, on create, etc) you will find most of these properties available to you, although they may be organized in a slightly different structure (ie: on get, everything but the `id` is nested inside an `attributes` object).

You can find more details in the [source code](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget/blob/master/app/src/models/widget.model.js).
