# Widget

## What is a Widget?

A widget is a graphic representation of a Dataset's data. Most of them are defined with [Vega grammar](#what-is-vega) but we can also find other custom definitions. Here are the [RW widgets definitions](https://github.com/resource-watch/notebooks/blob/develop/ResourceWatch/Api_definition/widget_definition.ipynb).

Widgets contain the following fields:

Field        |                         Description                          |    Type
------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------: | ------:
userId       |                       Id of the owner                        |    Text
application  |           Application to which the dataset belongs           |   Array

### Customize the query url of a widget

The `queryUrl` query parameter can be set if the user needs to modify the final url that will be requested. All parameters indicated in the `queryUrl` will be pass to the microservice.

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/049f074a-3528-427d-922b-3c2320e9caf6?queryUrl=/v1/query?sql=Select%20*%20from%20data&geostore=ungeostore
```


### Include related entities

When loading widget data, you can optionally pass an `includes` query argument to load additional data.

#### Vocabulary

Loads related vocabularies. If none are found, an empty array is returned.

### Pagination params

Field        |       Description        |   Type
------------ | :----------------------: | -----:
page[size]   | Number elements per page. There's a limit of 100 to the size of each page, which is not being enforced at the moment, but queries for larger page sizes are not supported. This means future requests may fail if not respecting the page size limit. | Number
page[number] |      Number of page      | Number

> Return the widgets from page 2, with 5 elements per page

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?page[size]=5&page[number]=2
```

### Sorting

The API currently supports sorting by means of the `sort` parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the widget, as well as `user.name` and `user.role` (sorting by user data is restricted to ADMIN users).

Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.

> Sorting widgets

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name
```

Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.


> Sorting widgets by multiple criteria

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name,slug
```

You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either `-` for descending order or `+` for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.

> Explicit order of sorting

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=-name,+slug
```

> Sorting widgets by the role of the user who owns the widget

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=user.role
```

### Include related entities

When loading widget data, you can optionally pass an `includes` query argument to load additional data.

#### Vocabulary

Loads related vocabularies. If none are found, an empty array is returned.

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?includes=vocabulary
```

}
```

#### User

Loads the name and email address of the author of the widget. If the data is not available (for example, the user has since been deleted), no `user` property will be added to the widget object.

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?includes=user
```

> Example response:

```json

It is possible to create a widget that has a different `env` property to its parent dataset.

> To create a widget, you have to do a POST request with the following body:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "widget": {
      "application":[
         "your", "apps"
      ],
      "name":"Example Carto Dataset"
      "published": true
   }
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Creating a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.
</aside>


## Update a Widget


To update a widget, you need to define all of the required fields in the request body. The fields that compose a widget are:

Field        |               Description               |    Type |                                          Values | Required

A user with role `USER` can update their own widgets, based on the `userId` field. A user with `ADMIN` role can update any widget.

> To update a widget, you have to do a PATCH request with the following body:

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id> \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "widget": {
      "application":[
         "your", "apps"
      ],
      "name":"New Example Carto Dataset Name",
      "widgetConfig": {}
   }
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Updating a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.
</aside>


## Clone a Widget

You can clone an existing widget as long as you have permissions to the applications associated with it. Basic usage requires no body params, but you can optionally pass a new `name` or `description` to be used in the creation of the new widget.


> To clone a widget, you should use one of the following POST requests:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>/clone \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

> You can optionally set a new name or description:


```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "name": "name for the cloned widget",
   "description": "
   "name": "name for the cloned widget", for the cloned widget",
}'
```

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id>/clone \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "name": "name for the cloned widget",
   "description": "
   "name": "name for the cloned widget", for the cloned widget",
}'
```

### Cloning widgets from other microservices

When cloning a widget, the newly created clone will take the `userId` of the originating request. If you call this endpoint as an authenticated user from your custom application, that means it will get that authenticated user's `userId`. However, if invoked from another API microservice, that `userId` is no longer available. In this scenario, when the request to clone is originated internally, you can optionally pass a `userÃŒd` body value that will be set as the `userId` of the newly created widget.

<aside class="warning">
User IDs provided this way are not validated.
</aside>

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget/<widget_id>/clone \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <microservice-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "userId": "123456789",
}'
```

<aside class="notice">
Cloning a widget will cause a thumbnail to be generated in the background for the new widget. As it is generated asyncronously, the newly generated thumbnail url may only become available on subsequent requests.
</aside>


## Delete a Widget

Who can delete Widgets?

- Users with the `MANAGER` role who are in the same app as the widget and are in the widget's `userId`
- Users with the `ADMIN` role who are in the same app as the widget.

<aside class="notice">
   The endpoints `/widget/:widget` and `/dataset/:dataset/widget/:widget` perform the same action, with the only difference being that the latter checks if the dataset exists before deleting the widget.
</aside>

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget/<widget_id> \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Widget reference

This section gives you a complete view at the properties that are maintained as part of widget. When interacting with a widget (on get, on create, etc) you will find most of these properties available to you, although they may be organized in a slightly different structure (ie: on get, everything but the `id` is nested inside an `attributes` object).

You can find more details in the [source code](https://github.com/resource-watch/widget/blob/master/app/src/models/widget.model.js).
