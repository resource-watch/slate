# Before you get started

This section covers a list of topics you should be familiar with before using the API. The concepts described here span across multiple API endpoints, and are important for a better understanding of how to interact with the RW API.

## Applications

As you might have come across while reading these docs, different applications and websites rely on the RW API as the principal source for their data. While navigating through the catalog of available datasets, you will find some datasets used by the [Resource Watch website](https://resourcewatch.org/), others used by [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/). In many cases, applications even share the same datasets!

To ensure the correct separation of content across the different applications that use the RW API, you will come across a field named `application` in many of the API's resources (such as datasets, layers, widgets, among others). Using this field, the RW API allows users to namespace every single resource, so that it's associated only with the applications that use it.
