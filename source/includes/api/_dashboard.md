## What is a dashboard

A dashboard contains the information to display a web page belonging to a user.

## Getting all dashboards

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?name=text&private=false
```

> Deprecated filter syntax:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?filter[name]=text&filter[private]=false
```

Available filters parameters:

Field          |                         Description                                               | Type

### Pagination

> Example request using query string parameters for paging the result:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?page[size]=15&page[number]=2
```

Field        |         Description          |   Type|   Default value
------------ | :--------------------------: | -----:| -----:
page[size]   | The number elements per page. The maximum allowed value is 100 | Number|   10
page[number] |       The page number        | Number|   1

### Sorting

> Sorting dashboards

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?sort=name
```

> Sorting dashboards by multiple criteria

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?sort=name,slug
```

> Explicit order of sorting

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?sort=-name,+slug
```

> Sorting dashboards by the role of the user who owns the dashboard

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?sort=user.role
```

Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.

You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either `-` for descending order or `+` for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.

The API currently supports sorting by means of the `sort` parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the dashboard, as well as `user.name` and `user.role` (sorting by user data is restricted to ADMIN users).

Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.

### Include related entities

When loading dashboards, you can optionally pass an `includes` query argument to load additional data.

#### User

> Example request including the information for the user who owns the dashboard:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dashboard?includes=user
```

> Example response:

```json
{
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "86",
        "type": "dashboards",
        "attributes": {
          "name": "Test dashboard three",
          "slug": "test-dashboard-three-cd4305e9-e3c8-456b-85a0-32eccb6100e6",
          "summary": "test dashboard three summary",
          "description": "test dashboard three description",
          "content": "test dashboard three description",
          "published": true,
          "photo": {
            "cover": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/image.jpg",
            "thumb": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/image.jpg",
            "original": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/image.jpg"
          },
          "user-id": "57ac9f9e29309063404573a2",
          "private": true,
          "production": true,
          "preproduction": false,
          "staging": false,
          "application":  ["rw"],
          "is-highlighted": false,
          "is-featured": false,
          "author-title": "",
          "author-image": {
            "cover": "/author_images/cover/missing.png",
            "thumb": "/author_images/thumb/missing.png",
            "original": "/author_images/original/missing.png"
          },
          "user": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "role": "ADMIN",
            "email": "john.doe@vizzuality.com"
          }
        }
      }
   ]
}
```

Loads the name and email address of the owner of the dashboard. If you request this issue as an authenticated user with ADMIN role, you will additionally get the owner's role.

If the data is not available (for example, the user has since been deleted), no `user` property will be added to the layer object.

## Getting a dashboard by its ID

However, compact, connected, and efficient growth can help ensure more competitive cities, and provide a better quality of life for citizens.

When creating a dashboard, the `application` field should be present and cannot contain any values that are not associated with the creating user's account. If an `application` value is not provided, `["rw"]` is used by default, and the process will fail if the user account does not belong to it. Any role can create a dashboard.

Supported fields:
