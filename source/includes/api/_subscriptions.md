# Subscriptions

## What is a subscription?

*Note: We strongly recommend that you read the [dataset concept](#dataset) and [dataset endpoints](#dataset6) sections before proceeding.*

A subscription allows you to get notified of updates on a datasets' data - either for every update, or for updates restricted to geographical areas of your interest. For example, you can use subscriptions to subscribe to deforestation alerts ([GLAD alerts dataset](http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/61170ad0-9d6a-4347-8e58-9b551eeb341e)) in the Amazon forest, or track fire alerts ([VIIRS fire alerts dataset](http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/64c948a6-5e34-4ef2-bb69-6a6535967bd5)) in your area of residence.

In the following sections, we will cover how you can interact and manage subscriptions in the RW API. We will see how you can customize subscriptions so that we only get notified for changes in a dataset's data for specific geographic regions. You will learn how to use them to get notified via email or calls to a URL you provide. We will also dive into subscription lifecycle, and understand how we can confirm subscriptions, resend confirmation emails and how to unsubscribe and stop receiving notifications.

## Subscription lifecycle

In this section, you will learn about the lifecycle of a subscription. This will help you understand how you can best use subscriptions to meet your goals. The first step for using subscriptions is understanding which data you want to subscribe - for this, we recommend [searching the existing datasets](/index-rw.html#getting-all-datasets) in the WRI API (or maybe even [creating a new one](/index-rw.html#creating-a-dataset)). Once you are certain of the dataset you wish to subscribe, the next step is ensuring that this dataset is subscribable.

### Subscribable datasets

> Example of a subscribable dataset

```json
{
  "name": "Example dataset",
  "application": ["app"],
  "provider": "carto",
  ...
  "subscribable": {
    "test": {
      "dataQuery": "SELECT * FROM dataset-name  WHERE 'reported_date' >= '{{begin}}' AND 'reported_date' <= '{{end}}' AND 'number_dead' > 0 ORDER BY reported_date DESC LIMIT 10",
      "subscriptionQuery": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dataset-name WHERE 'reported_date' >= '{begin}' AND 'reported_date' <= '{end}' AND 'number' > 0"
    }
  }
}
```

While you can create a subscription for *any* dataset, some conditions must be met by the dataset for its corresponding subscriptions to be functional and actually work as described here.

In order to support a functional subscription, a dataset must have some queries defined in its `subscribable` property. In this property, of type object, one (or many) sub-objects should be declared. Please note that you can define multiple keys in the `subscribable` object, and each key will be evaluated separately and trigger its own updates. Each object inside the `subscribable` property must define two queries:

* `dataQuery`, which will be evaluated as the subscription's content - i.e. this is what has been updated since the last check on the updates of this dataset.
* `subscriptionQuery`, which will be evaluated to check if a subscription has changed since the last update. This query should return a single row with the count of updated items since the last update check. If the value returned by this query is greater than 0, then all the subscriptions that reference this dataset will receive a notification.

The example on the side defines the `subscribable` object for an example dataset, and this object contains a the key `test`, including both a `dataQuery` and a `subscriptionQuery`. For more details on how you can modify the `subscribable` property of a dataset, check out the documentation on [updating a dataset](#updating-a-dataset). The keys in the subscribable object (e.g. `test`) are just for organizational purposes, and they won't be used in any way from the subscription's perspective.

Both queries can contain two special keywords: `{begin}` and `{end}`. These will be replaced with ISO-formatted dates on runtime, with the datetime in which the subscription was last evaluated, and the datetime at the time of evaluation, respectively.

*Please note that, for readability purposes, the special characters in example on the side are not properly escaped. Don't forget all special characters must be properly escaped for the queries to be correctly executed.*

### Creating and confirming the subscription

You have your dataset ready to be subscribed. The next steps would be to actually create the subscription - check the [docs for creating subscriptions](#creating-a-subscription) for detailed information on how to do that.

After creating the subscription, an email is sent with a confirmation link. You need to click this link in order to confirm the notification and start receiving notifications. You can check if the subscription is confirmed or not by looking at the `confirmed` field of the subscription object. Check more information about confirming subscriptions in the [confirming a subscription](#confirming-a-subscription) section.

If, for some reason, you have lost the confirmation email, you can check the [resending confirmation emails](#resending-the-subscription-confirmation-email) section for more information on how to resend the confirmation email.

At any point, you might want to stop receiving email or webhook notifications - if that is the case, you can check the [unsubscribing](#unsubscribing) section for details on how to stop receiving notifications for your subscriptions.

The same subscription can subscribe to multiple datasets - for that, you just need to provide all the dataset ids you intend to subscribe in either the `datasets` or `datasetsQuery` fields of the subscription on creation. However, a subscription can only notify a single email at a time - if you intend to receive subscription notifications on multiple emails, you'll need to create multiple subscriptions.

### How are subscription notifications sent?

```

Subscriptions support two types of notifications: emails or webhook requests is performed. Both notifications are checked and sent every day, assuming that the dataset data has changed since the last notification sent.

Webhook notifications are sent as POST requests to the URL saved in the subscription. You can check on the side an example of the data that is sent in the body of the POST call. Please note that the webhook POST body data can change, based on the dataset chosen to receive notifications.

You can see in the image below an example of an email notification for GLAD deforestation alerts:

![Subscription email example](images/subscription-email-example.png)

### Summary of the subscription lifecycle

* First, you should know which dataset to use and when its data gets updated.
* You ensure that the dataset is subscribable - if not, you should write the subscription queries and update the dataset.
* You create a subscription.
* You get a confirmation email and click on the link to confirm the subscription.
* Done! You will now get an email every day with the updates to the dataset data *(note that if there are no updates, no email is sent)*.
* Later, you can unsubscribe or delete the subscription.

## Getting subscriptions owned by the request user

> Getting the subscriptions for the request user:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

> Example response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "subscription",
      "id": "587cc014f3b3f6280058e478",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Test subscription",
        "createdAt": "2020-01-16T12:45:08.434Z",
        "userId": "57a063da096c4eda523e99ae",
        "resource": {
          "type": "EMAIL",
          "content": "example@wri.org"
        },
        "datasets": ["viirs-active-fires"],
        "datasetsQuery": [],
        "params": {
          "geostore": "50601ff9257df221e808af427cb47701"
        },
        "confirmed": false,
        "language": "en",
        "env": "production"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint will allow you to get all the subscriptions owned by the user who performed the request (identified by the access token). To use this endpoint, you must be logged in (i.e. a token must be provided). In the sections below, we’ll explore how you can customize this endpoint call to match your needs.

For a detailed description of each field, check out the [Subscription reference](#subscription-reference) section.

### Filters

The `v1/subscriptions` endpoint supports the following optional query parameters as filters:

Field       |  Description                                             | Type   | Default value
----------- | :------------------------------------------------------: | -----: | ---------------:
application | Application to which the subscription is associated. Read more about this field [here](/index-rw.html#applications). | String | 'gfw'
env         | The environment to which the subscription is associated. Read more about this field in the [Environments concept section](/index-rw.html#environments). | String | 'production'

**Deprecation notice:** the default value for the `application` filter (currently, `gfw`) will be removed and the `application` filter will then have no default value. We recommend reviewing your application to ensure you set and load the correct `application` explicitly.

### Errors for getting subscriptions

Error code     | Error message  | Description
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
401            | Unauthorized   | No valid token was provided in the request headers.

## Getting a subscription by id

> Example call for getting a subscription by its id:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

> Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscription",
    "id": "587cc014f3b3f6280058e478",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Test subscription",
      "createdAt": "2020-01-16T12:45:08.434Z",
      "userId": "57a063da096c4eda523e99ae",
      "resource": {
        "type": "EMAIL",
        "content": "example@wri.org"
      },
      "datasets": ["viirs-active-fires"],
      "datasetsQuery": [],
      "params": {
        "geostore": "50601ff9257df221e808af427cb47701"
      },
      "confirmed": false,
      "language": "en",
      "env": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

If you know the id of a subscription, then you can access it directly by performing a GET request to the `v1/subscriptions/:id` endpoint. Keep in mind that this will only match subscriptions that are owned by the user who performed the request.

### Errors for getting subscriptions by id

Error code     | Error message  | Description
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
400            | ID is not valid| The id provided is not a valid subscription id.
401            | Unauthorized   | No valid token was provided in the request headers.
404            | Subscription not found | Either no subscription exists with the provided id, or the subscription with the id provided is not owned by the user who performed the request.

## Creating a subscription

      },
      "datasets": ["20cc5eca-8c63-4c41-8e8e-134dcf1e6d76"],
      "params": {},
      "confirmed": false,
      "language": "en",
      "datasetsQuery": [],
      "env": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

This section will guide you through the process of creating a basic subscription in the RW API. Creating a subscription can be done by any logged user using a POST request and passing the relevant data as body fields. The supported body fields are as defined on the [subscription reference](#subscription-reference) section, but the minimum field list you must specify for all subscriptions are:

* `datasets` or `datasetsQuery`
* `resource` (which must include both `resource.type` and `resource.content`)
* `params`
* `application`
* `language`

If the creation of the subscription is successful, the HTTP response code will be 200 OK, and the response body will contain the created subscription object. Please note that **subscriptions must be confirmed** before they become active - refer to the [subscription lifecycle](#subscription-lifecycle) for more details on this.

### Errors for creating subscriptions

Error code     | Error message                       | Description
-------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------
400            | `<field>` required                  | You didn't provide one of the required fields.
401            | Unauthorized                        | No valid token was provided in the request headers.

### Defining the datasets

You will need to provide the dataset ids to which your subscription will watch for updates. In order to do so, you'll need to provide one of two fields when creating a subscription:

* `datasets` - this field is a simple array of dataset ids. Each dataset will be individually evaluated for updates, and it will trigger an email if the `subscriptionsQuery` returns greater than 0.
* `datasetsQuery` is an alternative way of defining the datasets to subscribe: using this field, you have the advantage of being able to define a different threshold for sending the email (i.e. the email is sent if the `subscriptionQuery` returns a count greater than the threshold defined in the `datasetsQuery` object). For more details on the structure of the objects inside `datasetsQuery`, please check the [subscription model reference](/index-rw.html#subscription-reference).

### Customizing the geographic area for the subscription

When it comes to geo-referenced data, subscriptions are intrinsically tied to a geographic area of interest. This association enables users to create subscriptions to be notified of changes in the data of a dataset, but only if there are changes in the data of the dataset relative to the concrete geographic area of the world they are interested in. The specification of the geographic information for the subscription should be done in the `params` field of the subscription.

#### Subscribing to an area of interest

> Creating a subscription providing the id of an area of interest in the params field:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "area": "35a6d982388ee5c4e141c2bceac3fb72"
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a specific area of interest that has been created using the [RW API Areas service](#areas). If this is the case, you should first [create your area of interest](#create-area), grab its id and provide it in the `params.area` field of the request body when creating the subscription.

Field         | Description                                                    | Type
------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params`      | Geographic area of the subscription                            | Object
`params.area` | Id of area of interest from the [RW API Areas service](#areas) | String

#### Subscribing to a country, country region or subregion

> Creating a subscription to a whole country:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "iso": {
        "country": "BRA"
      }
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

> Creating a subscription to a country subregion:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "iso": {
        "country": "BRA",
        "region": "1",
        "subregion": "2"
      }
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a country, one of its regions, or a subregion within a region. Countries are identified by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code - check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) for a list of all the available country codes. Regions and subregions are identified by their respective GADM id, which can be obtained from GADM's dataset [here](https://gadm.org/data.html). When creating a subscription for a region, the country ISO must be specified. For subscribing to a subregion, both region and country ISO must be provided.

Field                 | Description                                                    | Type
--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params.iso.country`  | ISO 3-letter code of the country to subscribe                  | String
`params.iso.region`   | Region id to subscribe                                         | String
`params.iso.subregion`| Subregion id to subscribe (optional)                           | String

#### Subscribing to a protected area from World Database on Protected Areas

> Creating a subscription providing a WDPA id in the params field:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "wdpaid": "32054"
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a specific protected area by the id of that area in the World Database on Protected Areas. If this is the case, you should provide the WDPA id in the `params.wdpaid` field when creating the subscription. IDs of protected areas worldwide can be obtained from the [Protected Planet website](https://www.protectedplanet.net/).

Field                 | Description                                                    | Type
--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params.wdpaid`       | Id of the protected area in the WDPA                           | String

#### Subscribing to a RW API geostore

> Creating a subscription providing the id of a geostore obtained from the RW API in the params field:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "geostore": "35a6d982388ee5c4e141c2bceac3fb72"
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a specific geostore that has been created using the [RW API Geostore service](#geostore). If this is the case, you should [create your geostore](#create-geostore) and use its id in the `params.geostore` field of the request body when creating the subscription.

Field                 | Description                                                    | Type
--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params.geostore`     | Id of the RW API geostore to subscribe to.                     | String

#### Subscribing to a GFW Data API geostore

> Creating a subscription providing the id of a geostore obtained from the GFW Data API in the params field:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \

    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a specific geostore that has been created using the GFW Data API. If this is the case, you should check the docs for the GFW Data API and create your geostore, then use its id in the `params.geostoreDataApi` field of the request body when creating the subscription.

Field                 | Description                                                    | Type
--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params.geostoreDataApi` | Id of the GFW Data API geostore to subscribe to.            | String

#### Subscribing to land use areas

> Creating a subscription providing the id of a land use area in the params field:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["<dataset-id>"],
    "params": {
      "use": "mining",
      "useid": "234"
    },
    "application": "gfw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": "production",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

A subscription can refer to a land use area provided by different datasets. At this point, the following land use datasets are supported: `mining` for mining areas, `logging` for Congo Basin logging roads, `oilpalm` for palm oil plantations or `fiber` for wood fiber plantations. If this is the case, you should provide the name of the land use dataset you wish to use in the `params.use` field, and the id of the area in the `params.useid` field of the request body when creating the subscription.

The ids to be used for land use areas can be obtained from the following CartoDB datasets:

* Mining area IDs can be obtained by querying [this dataset](http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/c2142922-84d9-4564-8216-a4867b9e48c5).
* Palm oil plantation IDs can be obtained from [this CartoDB table](https://wri-01.carto.com/tables/gfw_oil_palm/public/map).
* Wood fiber plantation IDs can be obtained from [this CartoDB table](https://wri-01.carto.com/tables/gfw_woodfiber/public/map).
* Congo Basin logging road IDs can be obtained from [this CartoDB table](https://wri-01.carto.com/tables/osm_logging_roads/public/map).

Field                 | Description                                                    | Type
--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------:
`params.use`          | The type of land use you want to subscribe to. Can be one of `mining`, `logging`, `oilpalm` or `fiber`. | String
`params.useid`        | The id of the land use area you want to subscribe to.          | String

## Updating a subscription

> Example PATCH request for updating a subscription by id:

```shell
curl -X PATCH "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "datasets": ["20cc5eca-8c63-4c41-8e8e-134dcf1e6d76"],
    "params": {
      "geostore": "35a6d982388ee5c4e141c2bceac3fb72"
    },
    "application": "rw",
    "language": "fr",
    "env": "staging",
    "resource": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "content": "email@address.com"
    }
  }'
```

> Example response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscription",
    "id": "5ee79291a67d9a001b11043a",
    "attributes": {
      "createdAt": "2020-06-15T15:24:01.806Z",
      "userId": "5ed75dd2a82a420010ed066b",
      "resource": {
        "type": "EMAIL",
        "content": "email@address.com"
      },
      "datasets": ["20cc5eca-8c63-4c41-8e8e-134dcf1e6d76"],
      "params": {
        "geostore": "35a6d982388ee5c4e141c2bceac3fb72"
      },
      "confirmed": true,
      "language": "fr",
      "datasetsQuery": [],
      "env": "staging"
    }
  }
}
```

You can update subscriptions associated with you user account by using the PATCH `v1/subscriptions/:id` endpoint. Updating a subscription follows the same validations as when creating a new one - i.e. all required field values must be provided, even if they remain the same. Values for fields other than the following are optional. The minimum fields list you must specify to update a subscription is:

* `datasets` or `datasetsQuery`
* `resource` (which much include `resource.type` and `resource.content`)
* `params`
* `application`
* `language`

If the update of the subscription is successful, the HTTP response code will be 200 OK, and the response body will contain the updated subscription object.

*Note: Updating a subscription does not require confirming it. A confirmed subscription will stay confirmed after an update.*

### Errors for updating subscriptions

Error code     | Error message                       | Description
-------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------
400            | `<field>` required                  | You didn't provide one of the required fields.

## Deleting subscriptions

> Example DELETE request for deleting a subscription by its id:

```shell
curl -X DELETE "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

> Example response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscription",
    "id": "5ee79291a67d9a001b11043a",
    "attributes": {
      "createdAt": "2020-06-15T15:24:01.806Z",

      "language": "fr",
      "datasetsQuery": [],
      "env": "staging"
    }
  }
}
```

To delete a subscription associated with your user account, you should use the DELETE `v1/subscriptions/:id` endpoint. If the deletion of the subscription is successful, the HTTP response code will be 200 OK, and the response body will contain the deleted subscription object.

### Errors for deleting subscriptions

Error code     | Error message                       | Description
-------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------
400            | Id is not valid                     | The id provided is not valid.
401            | Unauthorized                        | No valid token was provided in the request headers.
404            | Subscription not found              | Either a subscription with the id provided does not exist or it is not owned by the user who performed the request.

## Confirming a subscription

> Example GET request to confirm a subscription:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/confirm"
```

Upon creation of the subscription, a confirmation email is sent to the email of the user who created the subscription. This email will contain a link, which you will need to click in order to confirm the subscription. You can also confirm the subscription by performing a GET request to the `v1/subscriptions/:id/confirm` endpoint, as exemplified on the side.

*Manually calling this endpoint will redirect you to the GFW application.*

## Resending the subscription confirmation email

> Example GET request to resend the confirmation email for a subscription:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/send_confirmation" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

For convenience, the RW API offers an additional endpoint to resend the confirmation email. In order to do this, you should perform a GET request to the `v1/subscriptions/:id/send_confirmation`. As with most of the other subscription endpoints, please keep in mind that you must be authenticated in order to use this endpoint.

This endpoint does not change the subscription - i.e. if the subscription was already confirmed, it stays that way. The confirmation email will always be sent, regardless if the subscription is confirmed or not.

*Manually calling this endpoint will redirect you to the GFW application.*

## Unsubscribing

> Example GET request to unsubscribe:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/unsubscribe" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

**Note: When you unsubscribe, the underlying subscription resource is deleted.**.

You can use the endpoint `v1/subscriptions/:id/unsubscribe` (exemplified on the side) for unsubscribing from a subscription. As with most of the other subscription endpoints, please keep in mind that you must be authenticated in order to use this endpoint.

## Subscription reference

This section gives you a complete view at the properties that are maintained as part of a subscription. When interacting with a subscription (on get, on create, etc) you will find most of these properties available to you, although they may be organized in a slightly different structure (ie: on get, everything but the `id` is nested inside an `attributes` object).

You can find more details in the [source code](https://github.com/gfw-api/gfw-subscription-api/blob/develop/app/src/models/subscription.js).
