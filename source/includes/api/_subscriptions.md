# Subscriptions

Subscription represents to which datasets and analysis a user can have access to.

<aside class="notice">
Remember — All subscription endpoints need to be authenticated.
</aside>

## Subscribable datasets

In order to create a subscription, a dataset must be prepared to accept them. This is achieved by declaring some queries in the dataset json object sent to the `/v1/dataset` endpoint under the `subscribable`property.

```json
{
	"name": "dataset name",
	"application": ["app"],
	"provider": "dataset provider",
	"other": "dataset_fields",
    "subscribable": {
        "test_subscription": {
            "dataQuery": "SELECT * FROM dataset-name  WHERE \"reported_date\" >= '{{begin}}' AND \"reported_date\" <= '{{end}}' AND \"number_dead\" > 0 ORDER BY reported_date DESC LIMIT 10",
            "subscriptionQuery": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dataset-name WHERE \"reported_date\" >= '{begin}' AND \"reported_date\" <= '{end}' AND \"number\" > 0"
        }
    }
}
```

Inside the `subscribable` object, one (or several) sub-objects can be declared. In the provided example, the `test_subscription` is provided, with both a `dataQuery` and a `subscriptionQuery`. The former will be evaluated as the subscription's content, while the latter will be evaluated to check if a subscription has changed since the last update. Both queries can contain two special keywords: {begin} and {end}. These will be substituted with  ansi-formatted datetimes --with the datetime in which the subscription was last evaluated, and the datetime at the time of evaluation, respectively.

<aside class="notice">
Mind the string format: double quotes and curly braces need to be properly escaped.

<aside class="warning">The <code>application</code> field will soon be made required when creating a subscription.</aside>

<aside class="notice">
Remember — Subscriptions are created unconfirmed. A link for confirmation will be sent to the subscription email.
</aside>

A way to determine the area of interest for the subscriptions needs to be provided. A subscription can be created in six different ways:

### With an area

Field   |             Description             |            Type
------- | :---------------------------------: | --------------:
params  | Geographic area of the subscription |          Object
-- area |          Id of area object          | Text (ObjectId)

> To create a Subscription, you have to do a POST request with the following body:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
    "name": "<name>",
    "datasets": [
        "<dataset>"
    ],
    "params": {
        "geostore": "35a6d982388ee5c4e141c2bceac3fb72"
    },
    "datasetsQuery": [
        {
            "id": ":subscription_dataset_id",
            "type": "test_subscription",
            "threshold": 1
        }
    ],
    "application": "rw",
    "language": "en",
    "env": <environment>,
    "resource": {
        "type": "EMAIL",
        "content": "email@address.com"
    }
}'
```

In this case, a subscription is being created in reference to the `subscribable` field present in the previously defined dataset. After confirming the subscription the `subscriptionQuery` will be ran and its result will be compared against the `threshold`. If the query result is at least equal to the threshold, a new alert will be sent to the subscription's email.

### From country

## Resend confirmation

To resend the confirmation:

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/:id/send_confirmation \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

## Modify a subscription

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/:id \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

To modify a subscription, use the following PATCH endpoint. This endpoint requires authentication, and also you must be the owner of the subscription in order to edit it, otherwise the request will fail with `404 Not Found`.

The following fields are available to be provided when modifying a subscription:

Field         |                            Description                            |               Type | Required

## Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe from a subscription:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/:id/unsubscribe \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

## Delete subscription

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/:id/unsubscribe \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

To delete a subscription, use the following DELETE endpoint.

If the request comes from another microservice, then it is possible to delete subscriptions belonging to other users. Otherwise, you can only delete subscriptions if you are the owner of the subscription.



## Subscription statistics

Statistics endpoints require authentication by an ADMIN user.

### General subscription statistics



The `subscription/statistics` endpoint can be used to access all data regarding the subscription notifications that have been sent.

This endpoint supports the following query parameters as filters (please note that the dates must be formatted as MM-DD-YYYY):
