# Geometry Analysis

## Purpose
This tutorial intends to demonstrate a realistic example of how the `/query` API endpoint is used within a web application.
The `/query` endpoint is used to _access actual data points, get real numeric values for a subset of the full data, or interact with the proxied database_.
Queries extract information from the database and are how you get to the real data.
Queries are **not** how you get metadata about layers or datasets.
The calls to `/query` in this example will be refined with SQL statements like `SELECT <columns> WHERE <conditions>` that filter and transform the full dataset to only what is needed for the specific task.

The example will utilize three sources of information, reflecting the distributed nature of how information and derivative datasets are owned, stored, and transformed by different entities.

Here:

- Tree Cover Loss originates from [University of Maryland](https://glad.umd.edu/), but the raster tiles are prepared and hosted by WRI. This is the same dataset that was used in the earlier [quickstart tutorial](#mapbox-webmap-quickstart), so there should already be some familiarity with these raster tiles.
- a vector dataset of protected areas (think parks, reserves, etc) is created by a the [UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/) , but working with those detailed polygon geometries is a challenge - they are simply too large for many purposes; precomputed vector tiles are used instead, and these were created and hosted by WRI to fit our web needs.
- a hosted database table that links polygon geometries to tree-cover loss; this analysis is computationally intensive and for historical records unlikely to change frequently. Think of this as connecting to part of an OLAP system.

Over the course of this tutorial you will develop a simple web application that is capable of:

- interacting with the HTTP-based API to retrieve metadata and catalog information using the [`/dataset` endpoint](https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/index-rw.html#what-is-a-dataset).
- displaying raster and vector tiles in a webmap run by [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)
- dynamically querying a hosted database with the [`/query` endpoint](https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/index-rw.html#querying-datasets)


## Pre-requirements
This tutorial will interact with the RW-API, but will not require any authentication since the interactions will be read-only from publicly visible datasets.
You should be informed about the Resource Watch [Terms of Service](https://resourcewatch.org/terms-of-service) and [API Attribution Requirements](https://resourcewatch.org/api-attribution-requirements) before using the API.

This tutorial requires a [Mapbox Access Token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/) with a [token scope](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/tokens/#scopes) of `styles:read` to render the basemap.

It is also advised to review the quickstart tutorial, which introduces some of the topics relevant to using the API.

## Software specification
The specification for the webapp is:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
(A)  Display a large, interactive, Mapbox GL JS map

(B)  Display a raster layer of Tree Cover Loss (TCL)

(C)  Display a vector geometry layer of Protected Places (WDPA)

(D)  Use the /query API endpoint to perform a dynamic data lookup for each WDPA geometry
```

## Initial document structure
A basic "Hello World" setup for getting Mapbox GL JS online is given below.
This will ensure your Mapbox token is working and there is a basic foundation for the webpage.
This material is covered in the quickstart tutorial, but have a look over the script to jog your memory - some function names have changed, but most should be familiar.

Each section in this tutorial has a corresponding "finished" version [available on GitHub](https://github.com/resource-watch/doc-api/tree/master/extra/tutorial_content/webdev_geometry_analysis), which may be helpful if errors are encountered along the way.
This tutorial will have a single HTML file across all steps, but the associated javascript file (`tutorial-index.js`) will be changing at each step.

Copy the below text into a file called `index.html` inside a directory for this tutorial.

<div class="center-column"></div>

      position: absolute;
    }

    #map {

  </style>

</head>

    <div id="map-container">
      <div id="map"></div>
    </div>


  <script src="tutorial-index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This will establish a single top-level container called `map-container` and one child called `map`.

Next to `index.html` create a file called `tutorial-index.js`, and copy the following script.
Change your Mapbox access token.

<div class="center-column"></div>

	    'raster-opacity': 0.8,  // let mapbox baselayer peak through
            'raster-hue-rotate': 180
	}
    });
}

// vvvvv MAIN SCRIPT ACTIVITY BELOW vvvvvv

    zoom: 4,
    // longitude, latitude of the map center
    center: [20, 0]
});


// add the data layers once the map is loaded (API calls are asnyc)
map.on('load', async () => {

    const datasetIdForTCL = 'b584954c-0d8d-40c6-859c-f3fdf3c2c5df';
    // fetch remote dataset metadata
    const metadataForTCL = await callApiDatasetMetadata(datasetIdForTCL);

    const slugForTCL = getTreeCoverLossSlug(metadataForTCL);

    const tileLayerUrlForTCL = getTileLayerUrlForTreeCoverLoss(metadataForTCL);
    // add the Tree Cover Loss raster layer to the map
    addRasterTileLayerToMap(map, slugForTCL, tileLayerUrlForTCL);

});
```

Open `index.html` in a web browser and see a webpage that looks something like this:

![Image of basic webpage, with a title, a large map zoomed to central Africa, and a green and black map depicting tree cover loss](tutorials/webdev_geometry_analysis/webmap-initial-setup.png)

If you are not seeing a map check the web developer console.


## Vector tiles of protected areas
Next step is to add the polygons of protected areas, which warrants a short aside before adding it to the map.

This example is going to use the [World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)](https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas), which contains GIS-ready data on areas protected as nature reserves, parks, natural areas, and other categories of preservation.
The original dataset is large and full of finely traced park boundaries across the world - over 240-thousand polygons which in a compressed form is about 1.5 GB of data.
This is much too large to transfer to users.
When zoomed out to the continent or world view, the problem continues: excessive fine details and more polygons to display (or fetch remotely) at once.
These type of problems have motivated the creation of vector tiles, which mirror raster tiles in intention and design, but have the distinctive properties associated with the vector data model.

Vector tiles are normally constructed as derivatives of an original dataset, with downsampled and simplified geometries created at different _zoom levels_, but maintaining feature attributes and properties.
Like raster tiles, as you zoom in or out different tiles are fetched and rendered, reducing network burden by only pulling what is needed for the immediate view.
Using some data assimilation methods built into the web map, the vector geometries can be stitched across different tiles to create seamless geometries.
Vector tiles can have more than one _layer_, for example a street layer and a building layer, which helps reduce the need for lots of HTTP requests to render a complex map.

For WDPA, the dataset ID that will be used is:

<div class='center-column'></div>
```
a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8
```

Check out this dataset and metadata by making an API request to 

<div class='center-column'></div>
```
https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8?includes=layer,metadata
```

You can also use the developer console on the active webpage to do this through the function

<div class='center-column'></div>
```javascript
callApiDatasetMetadata('a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8')
```

The data retrieved should look like:

<div class='center-column'></div>
```
{
  "data": {
    "id": "a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8",
    "type": "dataset",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Protected Areas Vector Tiles (LM v3)",
      "slug": "Protected-Areas-Vector-Tiles-LM-v3",
      //...
      "layer": [
        {
          "id": "cd31fdff-3aa6-45fd-a36d-5a2079c20d5b",
          "type": "layer",
          "attributes": {
            "name": "Protected Areas - 2019",
            "slug": "Protected-areas-2019-Vector-Tiles",
            "dataset": "a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8",
            "description": "Legally protected areas by IUCN category. Updated monthly.",
            "provider": "tilelayer",
            //...
            "layerConfig": {
              //...
              "source": {
                "tiles": [
                  "https://tiles.globalforestwatch.org/wdpa_protected_areas/v201909/mvt/{z}/{x}/{y}"
                ],
                "maxzoom": 9,
                "minzooom": 3,
                "type": "vector"
              },
              "type": "vector"
            },
            "legendConfig": {
              //...
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      //...
    }
  }
}
```



Vector tiles typically are specified with a URL template structure such as `http://path.to/tile/directory/{z}/{y}/{x}` or similar.
Just like with the raster tile layer already on the map, you can drill into `['data']['attributes']['layer'][0]['attributes']['layerConfig']['source']['tiles'][0]` to find this templated URL.
Fortunately for this URL there are no additional templated parameters that need to be replaced before it is ready to use (see the `getTileLayerUrlForTreeCoverLoss` function for such a case).
In the script additions presented below the entire `source` object is extracted, as it contains the necessary specifications for adding a vector tile layer in Mapbox.


Add the following functions to `tutorial-index.js` before the `MAIN SCRIPT ACTIVITY` comment.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
// declare a function that returns the Mapbox-ready vector tile URL template
// (example.com/{x}/{y}/{z}) from the response object returned by `callApiDatasetMetadata`
// takes one parameter
//   (obj) the API response data
// returns an object representing a vector source, ready to be used by map.addSource().
const getTileLayerSourceForWDPAGeometries = (obj) => {
    // drill down to get a useful object
    return obj['data']['attributes']['layer'][0]['attributes']['layerConfig']['source'];
}


// declare a function that can add a raster tile layer to a Mapbox map
// takes four parameters:
//   (mapVar) the Mapbox map object
//   (title) a string identifier for the source and layer
//   (source) the vector tile source to add to the map
//   (layer) layer name in the vector tile - any vector tile can hold many different layers
const addVectorTileLayerToMap = (mapVar, title, source, layer) => {
    // need to first add a source
    mapVar.addSource(title, source);
    // then add the layer, referencing the source
    mapVar.addLayer({
	'id': title,
	'type': 'fill',
	'source': title,
	'source-layer': layer,
        'paint': {
            'fill-opacity': 0.25,
            'fill-color': '#A6CEE3'
        }
    });
}
```

Also modify the `map.on('load')` call to add this vector tile layer to the map.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
map.on('load', async () => {

    // LOAD TREE COVER LOSS RASTER TILES
    // declare the Dataset ID for Tree Cover Loss
    const datasetIdForTCL = 'b584954c-0d8d-40c6-859c-f3fdf3c2c5df';
    // fetch remote dataset metadata
    const metadataForTCL = await callApiDatasetMetadata(datasetIdForTCL);
    // get an identifier for the Tree Cover Loss raster tiles
    const slugForTCL = getTreeCoverLossSlug(metadataForTCL);
    // get the raster tile layer URL from full API response data
    const tileLayerUrlForTCL = getTileLayerUrlForTreeCoverLoss(metadataForTCL);
    // add the Tree Cover Loss raster layer to the map
    addRasterTileLayerToMap(map, slugForTCL, tileLayerUrlForTCL);

    // LOAD WDPA GEOMETRIES VECTOR TILES
    // declare the Dataset ID for WDPA Geometries
    const datasetIdForWDPAGeometries = 'a8360d91-06af-4f2d-bd61-4e50c8687ad8';
    // fetch remote dataset metadata
    const metadataForWDPAGeometries = await callApiDatasetMetadata(datasetIdForWDPAGeometries);
    // get the source information, including the vector tile URL, for WDPA Geometries
    const sourceForWDPAGeometries = getTileLayerSourceForWDPAGeometries(metadataForWDPAGeometries);
    // add the WDPA vector tile layer to the map
    addVectorTileLayerToMap(map, 'wdpa-tile-cache', sourceForWDPAGeometries, 'wdpa_protected_areas_201909');

});
```

The additions here enable similar functionality as already exists for the raster tile layer.
The dataset is fetched, partial information is extracted, and a small set of configuration parameters are specified to link the tool to the remote filestore.

In the execution of `addVectorTileLayerToMap(map, title, source, layer)` in the `map.on('load')` callback the last parameter `layer` is known ahead of time - this is not stored in the metadata and must be supplied by other means.
For a vector tile with only one layer, it is possible to inspect a `*.mvt` file with a text editor and look for likely layer names near the front of the file.
Utilities such as [`ogrinfo`](https://gdal.org/programs/ogrinfo.html) can also be employed to list layers, which is more direct than inspecting the binary file.

Here is the result of running `hexdump wdpa_tmp.mvt -C -n 256`, which in the right column shows an ASCII interpretation of the file.
After 8 bytes (`...(x...`) the layer name is declared (`wdpa_protected_areas_201909`), and following that are the names of the attributes/fields for that layer.

Here is the output of `ogrinfo wdpa_tmp.mvt`:

Reload in the browser to see the updated map, which should look like:

![Image of the webpage, with the same large map, but now with many semi-transparent white polygons representing the WDPA data.](images/tutorials/webdev_geometry_analysis/webmap-with-vector-tiles.png)

Pan around the map, zoom in and out, and watch the vector tiles load remotely or from the cache of already-seen tiles.


For the next step, interaction will be added to the polygons.
Currently if you click on a WDPA geometry nothing happens - it is as though these vectors are just painted on top of the raster tile.
From the above hexdump, and from not-listed-here information, it is known that the vector data has associated attributes, and we are going to display that.
In future steps this groundwork set us up to use some of that information for calls to the `/query` endpoint.


## Accessing vector attributes

As mentioned in the above section, vector tiles hold both geometry and attributes associated with each feature.
All features within the same vector tile layer will have the same set of attribute fields.
In this section, some of these attribute fields will be used in a popup that is displayed whenever a user clicks on a polygon.

From the hexdump in the previous section, you can see the names of the fields associated with the `wdpa_protected_areas_201909` layer, including `wdpaid`, `name`, `desig`, `status_yr`, and many more.
The full set of attributes is described in the [WDPA User Manual](https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/203/original/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf), or the quick list without descriptions can be obtained easily with `ogrinfo -so wdpa_tmp.mvt wdpa_protected_areas_201909`:

To enable a popup with some of this information, add the following to the javascript file, above the start of the main script execution.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
// declare a function that returns an HTML string to be displayed
// in the popup on a vector element.
// takes one parameter:
//   (f) an element of the vector tile
const popupContentForWDPA = async (f) => {
    // WDPA identifier string
    const wdpaId = f.properties['wdpaid'];
    // start assembling the string of HTML that will be displayed
    // first make a hyperlink to a details page for this geometry (external site)
    let content = '<span>name: ' + 
                     '<a target="_blank" ' + 
                        'href="https://protectedplanet.net/' + wdpaId + '" >' + 
                           f.properties['name'] +
                  '</a></span>';
    // add the identifier, since that is being used it should also be displayed
    content += '<br><span>wdpaid: ' + wdpaId + '</span>';
    return content;
}
```

and the following at the end of the file, after the map has been loaded.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
// When a click event occurs on a feature in the WDPA vector layer,
// open a popup at the location of the click.
map.on('click', 'wdpa-tile-cache', async (e) => {
    // get the features underneath the clicked point
    const features = map.queryRenderedFeatures(e.point, {layers: ['wdpa-tile-cache']});
    // create a popup at the clicked point
    new mapboxgl.Popup()
    .setLngLat(e.lngLat)
    .setHTML(await popupContentForWDPA(features[0]))  // use first feature if many selected
    .addTo(map);
});


// Change the cursor to a pointer when the mouse is over the WDPA layer.
map.on('mouseenter', 'wdpa-tile-cache', function() {
    map.getCanvas().style.cursor = 'pointer';
});


// Change it back to a pointer when it leaves.
map.on('mouseleave', 'wdpa-tile-cache', function() {
    map.getCanvas().style.cursor = '';
});
```

The function `popupContentForWDPA` simply returns the HTML that will be used within the popup.
There are two entries in the HTML string:

- the `name` of the area, which is hyperlinked to this entry on the [protectedplanet.net](protectedplanet.net) website using the `wdpaid` property to construct the URL.
- the `wdpaid`, a unique identifier for the protected area.

There is no necessity for this to be an async function currently, but in later steps async will be needed, so this is laying the groundwork.

The three calls at the end of the file exist to register functions with map events, importantly when a WDPA geometry is clicked, a popup will appear where the click occurred and display the two pieces of information described above.

In the next section the `/query` endpoint will be discussed.


## Querying a table

For the current example, the WDPA vector geometries has no _awareness_ of the tree cover loss values that are being displayed underneath them.
There is no simple way to do spatial statistics on the raster tiles - as you should recall, the raster tiles are pre-rendered RGB versions of a much larger and complex dataset.
The process for making the tiles is _lossy_ - there is no way to recover the _true values_ for tree cover loss from these rendered images.
But we do, in fact, need to display tree cover loss values for the protected areas.
Future tutorials will demonstrate _on-the-fly analysis_, but for now a more simple method will be employed.

Here we will use a pre-computed lookup table to connect WDPA geometries with tree cover loss metrics.
This table and its rows will be accessed through the `/query` endpoint using basic SQL functionality to _query_ a table and extract useable information.
This section of the tutorial will introduce the basics of the `/query` endpoint, describe the table being queried, and demonstrate how real queries look.

Let's begin with looking at the [`/query` endpoint reference](https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/index-rw.html#querying-datasets).
You should read over the section for a comprehensive understanding.
Below is a condensed version with the critical bits.

The `/query` endpoint is used primarily in conjuction with the `?sql=...` URL parameter, which defines the query to be performed using a basic subset of SQL.
All queries should be `SELECT`s, since they are _reading_ the information and not _updating_ the table.
In practice, queries are likely to have the traditional form of `SELECT .... FROM .... WHERE ....`.
The query construction will impact the structure of the returned information - you can get a single value, a list of values, or something looking like a table depending on what you request.
The response is by default a JSON-deserializable string, but with the `?format={json|csv}` parameter that can be changed.


The dataset ID for pre-computed tree cover loss within WDPA geometries is given below.
This will be used throughout this section and the next section, where the queries will be included in the web application.
For this section the queries will be made through the terminal or with the URL bar in your web browser.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
lookupTableId = 'a4d92f66-83f4-40f9-9d70-17297ef90e63';
```

Look at the Dataset by sending a GET request to:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/a4d92f66-83f4-40f9-9d70-17297ef90e63
```

The `legend` object in the response holds information about the structure and schema of the table.
Look over the column names, organized by data type.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
{                                                                                                
  ...
  "legend": {
    "date": [],
    "region": [],
    "country": [],
    "nested": [],
    "integer": [
      "umd_tree_cover_loss__year",
      "umd_tree_cover_density__threshold",
      "ifl_intact_forest_landscape__year"
    ],
    "short": [],
    "byte": [],
    "double": [
      "umd_tree_cover_loss__ha",
      "whrc_aboveground_biomass_loss__Mg",
      "whrc_aboveground_co2_emissions__Mg"
    ],
    "float": [],
    "half_float": [],
    "scaled_float": [],
    "boolean": [],
    "binary": [],
    "text": [],
    "keyword": [
      "wdpa_protected_area__id",
      "wdpa_protected_area__name",
      "wdpa_protected_area__iucn_cat",
      "wdpa_protected_area__iso",
      "wdpa_protected_area__status",
      "tsc_tree_cover_loss_drivers__type",
      "esa_land_cover_2015__class",
      "is__birdlife_alliance_for_zero_extinction_site",
      "gfw_plantation__type",
      "is__gmw_mangroves_1996",
      "is__gmw_mangroves_2016",
      "is__umd_regional_primary_forest_2001",
      "is__gfw_tiger_landscape",
      "is__landmark_land_right",
      "is__gfw_land_right",
      "is__birdlife_key_biodiversity_area",
      "is__gfw_mining",
      "is__peatland",
      "is__gfw_oil_palm",
      "is__idn_forest_moratorium",
      "is__gfw_wood_fiber",
      "is__gfw_resource_right",
      "is__gfw_managed_forest"
    ]
  },
  ...
}

```

Let's issue a basic query to get all fields (columns) for five rows, so we have an opportunity to look at the information in the table:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/?sql=SELECT * FROM a4d92f66-83f4-40f9-9d70-17297ef90e63 LIMIT 5
```

The response should look something like:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "wdpa_protected_area__id": 555531125,
      "wdpa_protected_area__name": "Peniche / Stª Cruz",
      "wdpa_protected_area__iucn_cat": "Not Reported",
      "wdpa_protected_area__iso": "PRT",
      "wdpa_protected_area__status": "Designated",
      "umd_tree_cover_loss__year": 2019,
      "umd_tree_cover_density__threshold": 10,
      "tsc_tree_cover_loss_drivers__type": "Forestry",
      "esa_land_cover_2015__class": "Settlement",
      "is__birdlife_alliance_for_zero_extinction_site": false,
      "gfw_plantation__type": 0,
      "is__gmw_mangroves_1996": false,
      "is__gmw_mangroves_2016": false,
      "ifl_intact_forest_landscape__year": 0,
      "is__umd_regional_primary_forest_2001": false,
      "is__gfw_tiger_landscape": false,
      "is__landmark_land_right": false,
      "is__gfw_land_right": false,
      "is__birdlife_key_biodiversity_area": false,
      "is__gfw_mining": false,
      "is__peatland": false,
      "is__gfw_oil_palm": false,
      "is__idn_forest_moratorium": false,
      "is__gfw_wood_fiber": false,
      "is__gfw_resource_right": false,
      "is__gfw_managed_forest": false,
      "umd_tree_cover_loss__ha": 0.2391284441558024,
      "whrc_aboveground_biomass_loss__Mg": 14.228141162972282,
      "whrc_aboveground_co2_emissions__Mg": 26.08492546544918,
      "_id": "AXJhK02CBq2MwHEKuVTU"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

Most of these fields are not needed for our current pursuit of associating tree cover loss with a WDPA geometry.
Some are very useful for that purpose, however:

- `wdpa_protected_area__id`: the identifier for a WDPA protected area
- `umd_tree_cover_loss__year`: the year of a record (row)
- `umd_tree_cover_density__threshold`: the threshold of tree density for a record (row)
- `umd_tree_cover_loss__ha`: the amount of forest loss in hectares for a record (row)

We will use these in the future for the web application, but let's quickly try out another query that utilizes more of the SQL capabilities.

Let's say you want to get an aggregated value for tree cover loss over a certain country.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/?sql=SELECT SUM(umd_tree_cover_loss__ha) AS total_loss FROM a4d92f66-83f4-40f9-9d70-17297ef90e63 WHERE wdpa_protected_area__iso='BRA' AND umd_tree_cover_loss__year=2015 AND umd_tree_cover_density__threshold=30
```

The return should look like:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "total_loss": 266476.8886672246
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

This query used:

- the `SUM` function to aggregate a numeric field (`umd_tree_cover_loss__year`)
- the `AS` assigner to give a meaningful label to output field
- the `WHERE` modifier to construct a clause that filters the rows
  - the country must be Brasil (ISO code BRA)
  - the year must be 2015
  - the threshold for consideration is 30% tree cover loss

Try to define more queries and explore the data a bit before moving to the next section.
When aggregating values always remember to subselect in a meaningful way to get meaningful output values.
In the above query it is important to supply a threshold in the `WHERE` clause, otherwise there is the potential for double counting (or multi-counting) the same lost forest (50% threshold fully encompasses the values for the 30% threshold).


## Dynamic queries at runtime

Now that we have experience with writing queries, let's integrate that into the web application.

Let's start with writing a function to do the querying.
As a reminder of our intention, we are trying to get a measure of tree cover loss associated with a single WDPA geometry.

Add this function above the main script execution.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
// declare an async function that calls an API endpoint for querying.
// this uses a pre-computed table that links WDPA identifiers to tree cover loss values.
// takes three parameters
//   (wdpaId) integer; the WDPA geometry ID, which uniquely identifies a protected area
//   (year) integer; the year of interest {2001 - 2019}
//   (threshold) integer; the tree cover loss threshold {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75}
// returns an object interpreted from the JSON response
const callApiQueryWDPATreeCoverLoss = async (wdpaId, year, threshold) => {
    //construct the query
    const queryDatasetId = 'a4d92f66-83f4-40f9-9d70-17297ef90e63';
    const sqlQuery = 'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/' + 
		     '?sql=SELECT SUM(umd_tree_cover_loss__ha) AS tcl_ha ' +
	                  'FROM ' + queryDatasetId + 
		          ' WHERE wdpa_protected_area__id=' + wdpaId +
		          ' AND umd_tree_cover_loss__year=' + year + 
	                  ' AND umd_tree_cover_density__threshold=' + threshold;
    // fetch the API endpoint (GET request)
    const response = await fetch(sqlQuery)
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    // convert response to JS object
    return response.json();
}
```

Reload the webpage and try this function with the developer console.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
await callApiQueryWDPATreeCoverLoss(40811, 2019, 30);
```

Now let's extract this information and get it into the popup.
In the below function you will see there are some additional metrics being inserted as well.

Delete the existing `popupContentForWDPA` function and replace it with the following:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
// declare a function that returns a string to be displayed
// in the popup on a vector element.
// takes one parameter:
//   (e) an element of the vector tile
const popupContentForWDPA = async (f) => {
    // subtract marine area from total area and convert from square km to hectare
    let landAreaHectare = (f.properties['rep_area'] - f.properties['rep_m_area']) * 100;
    // WDPA identifier will be used to query the TCL data table
    let wdpaId = f.properties['wdpaid'];
    // get the Tree Cover Loss area, which is returned in units of hectare
    let tclResponse = await callApiQueryWDPATreeCoverLoss(wdpaId, 2019, 30);

    // start assembling the string of HTML that will be displayed
    // first make a hyperlink to a details page for this geometry (external site)
    let content = '<span>name: ' + 
                     '<a target="_blank" ' + 
                        'href="https://protectedplanet.net/' + wdpaId + '" >' + 
                           f.properties['name'] +
                  '</a></span>';
    // add the identifier, since that is being used it should also be displayed
    content += '<br><span>wdpaid: ' + wdpaId + '</span>';
    // add the land area, truncating to two digits past the decimal
    content += '<br><span>land area (ha): ' + landAreaHectare.toFixed(2) + '</span>';
    // add the TCL area, truncating to two digits past the decimal
    content += '<br><span>2019 TCL area (ha): ' + tclResponse['data'][0]['tcl_ha'].toFixed(2) + '</span>';
    return content;
}
```

With the popup now able to display the tree cover loss for each polygon, let's reload the webpage and try it out!

![Image of the webmap, with a title, a large map zoomed to central Africa, a green and black map depicting tree cover loss, white polygons for WDPA features, and a popup with information about a selected polygon.](tutorials/webdev_geometry_analysis/webmap-final-popup.png)

## Next Steps

The `/query` endpoint is _the method_ for getting the real data.
The use of SQL-like functionality enables basic types of filtering, subselection, and aggregation to produce usable information.
There are of course limitations and not all SQL functionality is available, notably the _relational_ aspect that some may expect.
The `/query` endpoint does not support `JOIN`s and has very limited support for nested queries or subqueries.

Future tutorials will discuss on-the-fly analyses, which will bypass the need for pre-computed tables.
On-the-fly analysis allows for rasters to be _queried_ and analyzed with vector geometries, including those that are drawn by the user or not known ahead of time.
