# Introduction

Welcome to the Resource Watch API Developer Documentation. 


## Who is this for?

This section covers the behind-the-scenes details of the RW API, that are relevant for developers trying to build their own RW API microservice. If you are looking for instructions on how to use the RW API to power your applications, the [RW API Documentation](/) is probably what you are looking for.

The developer documentation is aimed at software developers that are familiar with the RW API from a user perspective, and want to extend or modify the functionality of the API. From a technical point of view, this section assumes you are familiar with some technologies, protocols and patterns that are used on the RW API, such as:

- [HTTP and HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- [Microservices architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

This guide also assumes you are comfortable with programming in general. To keep these docs simple, and as most of the RW API source code is written in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), that is the language we'll use for examples or when presenting specific tools and libraries. However, while we recommend using Nodejs, you may use different tools and/or languages when developing your microservices.  

If any of these concepts are new or unfamiliar, we suggest using your favourite search engine to learn more about them before proceeding.
