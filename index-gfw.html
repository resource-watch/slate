<p>Welcome to the Global Forest Watch API Documentation</p>

          <h1 id="about-these-docs">About these docs</h1>

<p>This documentation page aims to cover the Resource Watch API functionality and details. In it, you&rsquo;ll find a top-level description of the services it provides, as well as a breakdown of the different endpoints, their functionality, parameters and output. The goal is to give you the tools to create powerful applications and data products.</p>

<p>The RW API is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> based, and these docs assume you are familiar with both technologies. Besides endpoint descriptions, the documentation will include example code snippets that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">cURL</a> to illustrate how you would use each endpoint. Knowing the basics of cURL will help you better understand those examples. </p>

<p>For readability, URLs and query parameters may be displayed without escaping/encoding, but be sure to encode your URLs before issuing a request to the API, or it may produce undesired results. If you are using the RW API to build your own application, there&rsquo;s probably a library out there that does this for you automatically.</p>

<p>In these examples, you&rsquo;ll also find references to a <code class="prettyprint">Authorization: Bearer &lt;your-token&gt;</code> HTTP header. You can find more details about tokens in the <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> section, which you should read before you get started.   </p>

<p>Last but not least, the RW API and its docs are made by humans, who will occasionally make mistakes. If you find something that you think is incorrect, could be improved, if you want to contribute yourself, or just want to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, you can reach us through <a href="https://github.com/resource-watch/doc-api">the RW API documentation Github project page</a>.</p>

          <h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>

          <h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>

<p>One of the Resource Watch API&rsquo;s (RW API) goals is to provide a common interface for interacting with data hosted in different sources and formats. A <strong>Dataset</strong> is the Resource Watch&rsquo;s API way of providing users with access to data, while trying to, as much as possible, abstract and standardise operations that would otherwise fall on the user&rsquo;s hands to figure out. It&rsquo;s one of the cornerstones that many other API features build upon - and those features can help you get even more out of your data!</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A Resource Watch API dataset can represent data in a JSON file, hosted on <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> or <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">Google Earth Engine</a>, to name a few. However, when accessing that data, you don&rsquo;t have to learn 3 different technologies - the Resource Watch API gives you a single, unified query interface.</em></p>

<p>On top of <strong>datasets</strong>, the RW API offers multiple resources that allow you to access data in multiple formats. These will be covered later in full detail, but as an example, here are some ways in which you can access and use datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li>the RW API allows you to create <strong>Widgets</strong>, graphic representations of data, which can be made interactive to meet your custom needs;</li>
<li>if your data is georeferenced, you can use the <strong>Layers</strong> service to display data on informative maps;</li>
<li>you can create <strong>Subscriptions</strong> associated with datasets, and be notified via email of significant updates;</li>
<li>you can build your own <strong>Queries</strong> using a SQL-like syntax, and use the data to build your own custom visualizations.</li>
<li>the <strong>Metadata</strong> service offers you a way to provide additional details about your data, like multi-language descriptions that will allow you to reach a broader audience</li>
<li>the <strong>Geostore</strong> service allows you to access or save geometries, offering lots of useful tools when handling georeferenced datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dataset-providers">Dataset providers</h3>

<p>Each dataset has a <strong>provider</strong> (json/carto/GEE/&hellip;) that must specified on creation - it&rsquo;s this value that tells the RW API how to handle different data providers and formats, so you don&rsquo;t have to. Below you&rsquo;ll find a list of the different providers supported:</p>

<h4 id="carto">Carto</h4>

<p><a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> is an open, powerful, and intuitive map platform for discovering and predicting key insights underlying the location data in our world.</p>

<p>Data provided in the form of a XML document.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-connector-type">Dataset connector type</h3>

<p>Each dataset provider has an associated <strong>connector type</strong>, which you can determine using the table below. </p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Connector type</th>
<th>Providers</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>document</td>
<td><code class="prettyprint">csv</code>, <code class="prettyprint">json</code>, <code class="prettyprint">tsv</code>, <code class="prettyprint">xml</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rest</td>
<td><code class="prettyprint">cartodb</code>, <code class="prettyprint">featureservice</code>, <code class="prettyprint">gee</code>, <code class="prettyprint">bigquery</code>, <code class="prettyprint">rasdaman</code>, <code class="prettyprint">nexgddp</code>, <code class="prettyprint">loca</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wms</td>
<td><code class="prettyprint">wms</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The connector type reflects an important aspect of a dataset: where is the actual data kept, and how is it accessed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">document</code> connector type: a dataset that uses this connector type has its data hosted on the RW API database. For example,   datasets with provider <code class="prettyprint">json</code> are based on user provided JSON files, and have the <code class="prettyprint">document</code> connector type. This means that, on dataset creation, the content of the provided JSON files is copied onto an internal RW API database, and future queries will get their data from that database - the actual JSON files are not used after the creation process is done.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">rest</code> connector type: a dataset that uses this connector type proxies the underlying service specified as <code class="prettyprint">provider</code>. For example, a dataset that uses the provider <code class="prettyprint">cartodb</code> has the connector type <code class="prettyprint">rest</code>. This means that queries to that dataset will cause the API to query the carto URL provided, and pass the result to the user. Apart from temporary caches, the actual data is never kept on the RW API itself. The underlying carto table needs to exist and be accessible for the RW API dataset to work.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">wms</code> connector type: this connector type is used only for datasets that use the <code class="prettyprint">wms</code> provider. The RW API does not access the data for these datasets. </li>
</ul>

          <h2 id="query">Query</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we covered the concept of a RW API dataset which, in simple terms, is a way to tell the RW API that your data exists, and where. While cataloging datasets in a public repository is useful, making that data easily accessible is one of the main goals of the RW API. This is where <strong>queries</strong> come in.</p>

<p>In the context of the RW API, a dataset query is very similar an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> query would be to a database - it&rsquo;s a specially crafted statement that allows you to express what data you want, from which dataset, and with which structure. The RW API will use that query to get you the data you need, in the format you asked for, so that it&rsquo;s easy to use in the context of your applications. While it doesn&rsquo;t comply (nor does it attempt to) with any of the formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> specifications, RW API queries use a SQL-like syntax that will be very familiar to anyone who has worked with a relational database in the past. If that&rsquo;s not your case, there are many tutorials out there that will help you learn the basics in no time.</p>

<p>Using this common, SQL-based syntax, RW API queries allow you to query its datasets using a common API and syntax, no matter where the actual underlying data is hosted. Querying a carto dataset is the same as querying a JSON document or a BigQuery table. This is one of the main goals of the RW API, and one of most valuable features we offer you, the end user - using a single tool and language, you can quickly query data from a wide range of sources, on a broad set of topics.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#query9">query endpoint documentation</a> below, we&rsquo;ll go into more detail on how you can submit your queries to the API, the specifics of more advanced operations and detailed limitations of querying the RW API but, for now, there are 3 high-level ideas that you should keep in mind:</p>

<h3 id="all-queries-should-be-select-queries">All queries should be <code class="prettyprint">SELECT</code> queries</h3>

<p>Querying in the RW API is meant to be used only to read data, not to manipulate it. If you have used SQL before, you know it can be used to modify data, but, as a rule of thumb, that&rsquo;s not the approach used in the RW API. If you&rsquo;d like to modify the data of a dataset, you should use the <a href="#updating-a-dataset">dataset update</a> endpoints instead. The only exception to this is for deleting data from document-based datasets - check <a href="index-rw.html#deleting-data-from-a-dataset">here</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="not-all-sql-constructs-are-supported">Not all SQL constructs are supported</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used SQL in the past, you know how powerful (and complex) it can be. Things like nested queries or joins can be hard to use and even more to maintain, even without the added complexity of an environment where multiple data providers coexist. That&rsquo;s why the RW API limits its support to basic SQL syntax, so we can focus on delivering a tool that&rsquo;s simple and easy to use for most users. The <a href="#supported-sql-syntax-reference">supported SQL syntax reference</a> section below will go into more detail on what&rsquo;s supported and what&rsquo;s not, and will help you understand the specifics of what you can achieve with RW API queries.</p>

<h3 id="some-operations-will-depend-on-the-provider-of-the-dataset-you-39-re-querying">Some operations will depend on the provider of the dataset you&rsquo;re querying</h3>

<p>Our goal is to provide a common querying interface across all datasets, independent of their provider. While we believe we&rsquo;ve achieved it in most cases, RW API queries can only be as powerful as the underling provider (and their own APIs) allows them to be. There are cases in which a given SQL construct or function is supported for a given provider, but not for another. The <a href="#supported-sql-syntax-reference">supported SQL syntax reference</a> below has more details on these limitations, per provider.</p>

          <h2 id="layer">Layer</h2>

<p>Apart from the possibility of fetching data from multiple data sources using a common interface, the RW API provides you with features to help you visualize such data. A <strong>layer</strong> is one of the resources that you can use to help you make custom visualizations for your data, and they play a very important role when visualizing datasets that contain geospatial data.</p>

<p>A layer is a visual specification of how the data of a dataset can be rendered and styled on a map. It stores data that will help your applications render dataset data as a map layer, using tools like <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox GL JS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Vizzuality/layer-manager">Layer Manager</a>. In this sense, it&rsquo;s important to emphasise that a layer object does not store the actual data to be represented - it instead stores the information that those rendering tools will use to render your data. Rephrasing it: the data should come from the dataset (through queries), while a layer provides the information about how that data is meant to be rendered by the corresponding rendering tool.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#layer8">layer endpoint documentation</a>, we&rsquo;ll go into more detail on how you can manage layers, as well as the existing limitations that you might run into when using layers. However, for now, there are 3 high-level ideas that you should keep in mind:</p>

<h3 id="the-layer-does-not-interact-with-dataset-data">The layer does not interact with dataset data</h3>

<p>Layers store visual configurations needed for rendering styling a given dataset&rsquo;s data. However, they do not interact with the dataset data in any way. It is your responsibility, as a RW API user, to build the appropriate queries to retrieve the data that you want to display (read more about <a href="#dataset">datasets</a> or <a href="#query">how you can query datasets to obtain their data</a>). Remember, use layers as a complement of dataset queries, not a replacement.</p>

<h3 id="most-of-layer-fields-are-free-form">Most of layer fields are free-form</h3>

<p>Many of the fields in the layer object are free-form, meaning the RW API does not apply any restriction to whatever is saved in those fields. This is great, because it allows for a very high level of flexibility for users, but has the downside of making it harder to document how to use layers. We tried our best to provide clear and consistent specifications for all the fields of a layer, but keep in mind that this high level of flexibility makes it harder to deliver a concrete description.</p>

<h3 id="different-applications-and-rendering-tools-use-layers-in-different-ways">Different applications and rendering tools use layers in different ways</h3>

<p>At the moment, most applications using the layer endpoints have adapted layers to tailor fit their needs, taking advantage of the flexibility that free-form fields bring. This means that, when navigating through the catalog of available layers, you might run into very different ways of implementing and using layers. Once again, we will try our best to cover the different ways of using and managing layers, but keep in mind that there is currently no standard way of using layers.</p>

<p>As layers are typically managed within the realm of a RW API based application, they typically contain data that covers the needs of that application&rsquo;s specific rendering tool. This again means that you may find varying structure in the data contained in a layer.</p>

          <h2 id="widget">Widget</h2>

<p>You have fetched your data from your <a href="#dataset">dataset</a> using <a href="#query">queries</a>. And you know how to build custom visualizations for geospatial data using <a href="#layer">layers</a>. Yet, sometimes you want to build a plain graphical representation of your data - whether it is geo-referenced or not: this is when <strong>widgets</strong> come in handy.</p>

<p>A <strong>widget</strong> is a visual specification of how to style and render the data of a dataset (think pie, bar or line charts).</p>

<p>As with layers, each widget has a single dataset associated with it, and a dataset can be associated with many widgets. You can represent the same data in different ways by creating different widgets for the same dataset. The same widget can store independent configuration values for each RW API based application. It can also contain the required configuration for rendering the same visualization using different rendering tools.</p>

<p>However, this association between widgets and datasets is only for organizational purposes. As such, like in the case of layers, the widget itself does not interact with the dataset data. You can either use the widget&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">queryUrl</code> field to store the query to get the widget&rsquo;s data or store it inside the free form <code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code> object. In any of these cases, it is your responsibility as an API user to query the data that will be used for rendering the widget.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#widget9">widget endpoint documentation</a>, you can get into more detail on how you can manage widgets.</p>

<h3 id="widget-configuration-using-vega-grammar">Widget configuration using Vega grammar</h3>

<p>As in the case of layers (where many fields are free-form), the RW API does not apply any restriction to the data saved in the widget configuration field (<code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code>). This allows for a very high level of flexibility for users but has the downside of making it harder to document how to use widgets.</p>

<p>However, the existing widgets&rsquo; standard approach for building widget configuration objects is using <a href="https://github.com/vega/vega">Vega grammar</a>. Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating interactive visualization designs. You can then use a chart library that supports Vega grammar syntax (such as <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>) to render the widget and get your graphical representation.</p>

<p>Please note that, in any case, you can use whatever configuration format you wish since the <code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code> field is free-form.</p>

          <h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>

<p>The RW API provides most of its data through endpoints that are available to all users, without requiring any form of registration. However, some actions, like uploading data or flagging a resource as a favourite, require having a user account and using an access token when issuing requests to the API.</p>

<p>In this section you will learn the very basics of how you can quickly create a user account and use your token to authenticate requests. For more in-depth details on authentication, token and user management, refer to the <a href="#user-management">User Management</a> section of the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="logging-in-or-registering-a-new-user-account">Logging in or registering a new user account</h2>

<p>The easiest way to access your account is through the <a href="https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth/sign-up">login page</a> of the RW API. Here you can authenticate using your existing Facebook, Google, Twitter or Apple account, or you can register or login using your email address and password. </p>

<p><em>Note: if you create a new user account using email and password, a confirmation link will be sent to the email address you provided. Your account will only be active once you&rsquo;ve clicked the link in that email, so ensure that you use a valid email address. If you don&rsquo;t receive this email message within a few minutes, check your spam.</em></p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve successfully logged in using your browser, you&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;Welcome to the RW API message&rdquo; on your browser. You can now generate user tokens.</p>

<p><img src="images/authentication/auth-success.png" alt="Auth success" /></p>

<h2 id="how-to-generate-your-private-token">How to generate your private token</h2>

<p>The RW API uses JWT <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">(JSON Web Tokens)</a> tokens to identify and authenticate its users. If your are not familiar with the details of JWT, just think of them as a very long strings of characters that you need to attach to your requests to the RW API, to prove that you are you.</p>

<p>To get you token, you first need to login using your browser and the steps above. No matter which login strategy you prefer, once you&rsquo;ve logged in, you can visit <a href="https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth/generate-token">https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth/generate-token</a> to get your token.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: treat a token in the same way you would treat a password - don&rsquo;t share it and always store it in a safe place (like a password manager, for example). A token is sufficient to authenticate you on the RW API, meaning that, if someone else gains access to your token, they&rsquo;ll be able to do anything that you would be able to do on the RW API, even without access to your Facebook/Google/Twitter/Apple login or your email and password.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-your-private-token-to-authenticate-a-request">How to use your private token to authenticate a request</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Example of how a request with a token is structured</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your token&gt;"</span> <span class="se">\</span>

    "application":[
      "gfw", 
      "forest-atlas"
    ]
  }
}'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have your token, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the RW API. Depending on which endpoints you are trying to use, certain actions may become available by simply authenticating your request. Other will require your account to have a special role or applications, which we&rsquo;ll cover in more detail in the <a href="#user-management">User Management</a> documentation.</p>

<p>Tokens must be provided in HTTP request header, named as <code class="prettyprint">Authorization</code>, with the structure <code class="prettyprint">Bearer &lt;your token&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Once generated, a token is valid until any of the associated user information (name, email, or associated applications) changes. If your token becomes invalid, you will need to log in and go to <a href="https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth/generate-token">https://api.resourcewatch.org/auth/generate-token</a> to generate a new token.</p>

          <h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>

<p>The following contact endpoints are available</p>

<h2 id="contact-us">Contact us</h2>

<p>Sends a contact form including a topic, email address, and a message. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-dataset">What is a dataset?</h2>

<p>If you are new to the RW API, or want to learn more about the concept of a dataset, we strongly encourage you to read the <a href="#dataset">dataset concept</a> documentation first. It gives you a brief and clear description of what a dataset is, and what it can do for you.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve read that section, you can come back here to learn more details about using the RW API&rsquo;s datasets feature. The RW API is home to many datasets uploaded by <a href="https://www.wri.org/">WRI</a>, its partner organizations, or by API users like you. These datasets contain a lot of information about a wide range of topics that you may want to learn about or build on top of. To find out more about finding and accessing the datasets already available on the RW API, check out the documentation on <a href="#getting-all-datasets">getting datasets</a>. A nice, visual way to explore existing datasets is by using the <a href="https://resourcewatch.org/">Resource Watch</a> website. </p>

<p>You can also <a href="#creating-a-dataset">create you own datasets</a> on the RW API, if you&rsquo;d like to share your data with the world, or 
 if you are looking to use the RW API and its features to gain insights into your data.</p>

<h2 id="getting-all-datasets">Getting all datasets</h2>

<p>This endpoint will allow you to get the list of the datasets available in the API, and it&rsquo;s a great place for new users to start exploring the RW API. By default, this endpoint will give you a paginated list of 10 datasets. In the sections below, we&rsquo;ll explore how you can customize this endpoint call to match your needs. </p>

<p>For a detailed description of each field, check out the <a href="#dataset-reference">Dataset reference</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="pagination">Pagination</h3>

<p>The RW API lists many of its resources as pages, as opposed to showing all results at once. By default, datasets are listed in pages of 10 datasets each, and the first page is loaded. However, you can customize this behavior using the following query parameters:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Custom pagination: load page 2 using 25 results per page</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset?page[number]<span class="o">=</span>2&amp;page[size]<span class="o">=</span>25

<p>The dataset list provides a wide range of parameters that you can use to tailor your dataset listing. Most of these parameters reflect fields you&rsquo;ll find in a dataset itself (which you can learn more about in the <a href="#dataset-reference">Dataset reference</a> section), while others are convenience filters for things like user role or favourites. These parameters can be combined into a complex <code class="prettyprint">and</code> logic query.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>String types support and expect a regex value, unless detailed otherwise on the <code class="prettyprint">Description</code> field. Although typically they will match exact strings, you may have to escape certain characters (PCRE v8.42 spec).</li>
<li>Array types support multiple values. Use <code class="prettyprint">,</code> as an <code class="prettyprint">or</code> multi-value separator, or <code class="prettyprint">@</code> as a multi-value, exact match separator.</li>
<li>Object types expect a boolean value, where <code class="prettyprint">true</code> matches a non-empty object, and <code class="prettyprint">false</code> matches an empty object.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset?sort<span class="o">=</span>user.role
</code></pre>
<p>The API currently supports sorting by means of the <code class="prettyprint">sort</code> query parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset model</a>, as well as <code class="prettyprint">user.name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> (sorting by user data is restricted to ADMIN users). Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.</p>

<p>Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.</p>

<p>You can also specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either <code class="prettyprint">-</code> for descending order or <code class="prettyprint">+</code> for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.</p>

<h4 id="special-sorting-criteria">Special sorting criteria</h4>

</code></pre>
<p>Special search criteria must be used as sole sorting criteria, as it&rsquo;s not possible to combine any of them with any other search criteria. The following criteria can be used for special sorting in datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">most-viewed</code> delegates sorting to the graph component, sorting by the datasets that have been queried more frequently. Supports ascending/descending order.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">most-favorited</code>: delegates sorting to the graph component, sorting by the datasets that have been more favorited. Supports ascending/descending order.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">relevance</code>: delegates sorting to the metadata component, sorting by the datasets which metadata better match the search criteria. Can only be used in conjunction with a <code class="prettyprint">search</code> parameter. Does not support ascending order.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either <code class="prettyprint">-</code> for descending order or <code class="prettyprint">+</code> for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-dataset">Creating a dataset</h2>

<p>So you are ready to create your first dataset on the RW API? Great, welcome aboard! These instruction will help you create your dataset on the RW API, so you can start sharing your data with the world and taking full advantage of all the RW API features on your projects.</p>

<p>Before creating a dataset, there are a few things you must know and do:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to be able to create a dataset, you need to be <a href="#authentication">authenticated</a>.</li>
<li>Depending on your user account&rsquo;s role, you may have permission to create a dataset but not delete it afterwards.</li>
<li>All data uploaded to the RW API will be publicly visible and available to other users. </li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing to consider when creating a dataset is where your data currently is - this will determine the <a href="#dataset-providers">Dataset provider</a> you will need to use and, with it, a set of things you need to take into account - we&rsquo;ll cover each provider in detail shortly. When building your request to the RW API to create your dataset, you will need to take into account both the general details that follow, plus the details for the <code class="prettyprint">provider</code> you are using. Be sure to review both sections when creating your datasets, to avoid any pitfalls.</p>

<p>Creating a dataset is done using a POST request and passing the relevant data as body files. The supported body fields are as defined on the <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset reference</a> section, but the minimum field list you must specify for all datasets is:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>application</li>
<li>connectorType</li>
<li>provider </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, depending on the data provider you will be using, other fields may be required - we&rsquo;ll cover those in detail in each provider&rsquo;s specific documentation.</p>

<p>A successful dataset creation request will return a 200 HTTP code, and the dataset details as stored on the RW API. PAy special attention to the <code class="prettyprint">id</code> or the <code class="prettyprint">slug</code>, as those will allow you to <a href="#getting-a-dataset-by-id-or-slug">access your dataset</a> later.</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s one aspect of the dataset creation process that you need to keep in mind: it is an asynchronous process.</strong> This means that a successful call to the create dataset endpoint will <em>start</em> the process, but the dataset may not be immediately available to be used. The <code class="prettyprint">status</code> field will tell you if the dataset creation process is in progress (status set to <code class="prettyprint">pending</code>), if something went wrong (<code class="prettyprint">failed</code>, in which case the <code class="prettyprint">errorMessage</code> field will have a short description of what went wrong) or if the dataset is available to be used (when status is <code class="prettyprint">saved</code>). The amount of time it takes for a newly created dataset to go from <code class="prettyprint">pending</code> to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code> depends on the provider and amount of data. Just keep in mind that you need to wait for the status to be set to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code> before starting to use your datasets. You should <a href="#getting-a-dataset-by-id-or-slug">check your dataset</a> manually to see when the <code class="prettyprint">status</code> is updated.</p>

<p>When creating a document based dataset, you have multiple ways of providing your data to the API, of which you should use only one:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code class="prettyprint">sources</code> field expects a list of URL containing files in the format matching your <code class="prettyprint">provider</code> value. This is the recommended way of uploading data.</li>
<li>The <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> field is similar to <code class="prettyprint">sources</code>, but it only accepts a single value. <strong>Deprecation notice</strong>: The previously used <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> field should be considered deprecated when creating document-based datasets.</li>
<li>If creating a dataset based on JSON data, you can upload the data on the actual request you issue to the API, inside the <code class="prettyprint">data</code> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data passed in <code class="prettyprint">sources</code> or <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> must be available on a publicly accessible URLs, specified in the <code class="prettyprint">sources</code> array field or the <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> single value field. The URLs must be an accessible CSV, TSV or XML file, non-compressed - zip, tar, tar.gz, etc are not supported. <code class="prettyprint">sources</code> allows you to specify multiple URLs for a single dataset, provided all files have the same format and data structure. This is particularly useful when creating very large datasets, as it will allow the creation process to be parallelized. No warranties are provided about the order in which the files or their parts are imported.</p>

<p><em>Notice: If you want to create a dataset from a file you have, but that it&rsquo;s not available on a public URL, check out our docs for <a href="#uploading-a-dataset">uploading a dataset</a>.</em></p>

<p>Unlike with other dataset types, when the dataset is created, the data is copied from the provided source into the API&rsquo;s internal Elasticsearch instance, which is the source used for subsequent queries or other operations. This has a few implications that you should be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The URLs provided in <code class="prettyprint">sources</code> or <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> will be publicly visible to all RW API users.</li>
<li>On dataset creation, those URLs will be visited as the API loads and copies your data.</li>
<li>Queries to the dataset will use the API&rsquo;s internal copy of your data. If you wish to update that data, see the documentation below on how to update your data.</li>
<li>If the URLs provided become unavailable after the creation process is over, the dataset will continue to work normally - your data will still be available online.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Notice: When creating a document-based dataset, if any of the fields has a numerical name (for example, column: <code class="prettyprint">3</code>), a string named <code class="prettyprint">col_</code> will be appended to the beginning of the name of the column. This way, an uploaded column named <code class="prettyprint">3</code> will become <code class="prettyprint">col_3</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>Tip: If you want to periodically and automatically update your document based dataset with new data, check out the <a href="#dataset-automatic-synchronization">dataset automatic synchronization</a> functionality.</em></p>

<p>When creating a document-based dataset, the RW API will start a complex process that copies your data into the API&rsquo;s internal database, and perform certain indexing actions. This process is called a <strong>Task</strong>, and is given a <code class="prettyprint">taskId</code> that is stored on the dataset&rsquo;s field with the same name. Depending on the size of your dataset, this may take from a few seconds to a few hours to complete. The result of this import process will determine if the dataset&rsquo;s status will be set to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code> or <code class="prettyprint">error</code>. You can follow this process by using the <code class="prettyprint">taskId</code> value with the <a href="#get-a-single-task">Tasks API</a>.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-legend-fields-to-define-field-types">Using the legend fields to define field types</h4>

<p>By default, when creating a document based dataset, the data is ingested by the API and the field types are automatically determined by the underlying Elasticsearch <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/mapping.html#_dynamic_mapping">dynamic mapping API</a>.
However, in some scenarios, it may be desirable to specify some or all of these mappings manually, to match each field type to its Elasticsearch equivalent.</p>

<p>When defining manual mappings, you don&rsquo;t need to map every single field. When processing the data, if a field is found for which there isn&rsquo;t a manual mapping, Elasticsearch will fallback to its dynamic mapping algorithm to try and guess that field&rsquo;s type. This API only supports a single explicit mapping per field, meaning you cannot declare a given field as both <code class="prettyprint">text</code> and <code class="prettyprint">keyword</code> for example.</p>

<p>Field mapping can only be defined on dataset creation. Should you want to change these mappings, you can only do so by creating a new dataset with the new mapping structure.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">legend</code> field allows explicitly identifying the following mappings:</p>

If your file is up to 4MB in size, you can upload it to the API by using the <code class="prettyprint">upload</code> endpoint. 
This endpoint accepts a file in the &ldquo;dataset&rdquo; field of your POST request, and a <code class="prettyprint">provider</code> that matches your file type and extension. 
The supported formats/extensions are: csv, json, tsv, xml, tif, tiff and geo.tiff.
The request uploads the file to the API, and returns a specially crafted <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> value, and a list of fields found in your file.
With this data, you can create a document type dataset by passing it to the <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code> value of a <a href="#document-based-datasets-json-csv-tsv-or-xml">new document type dataset</a>.</p>

<h2 id="updating-a-dataset">Updating a dataset</h2>

<p>There are multiple options to update a dataset, depending on what modification you are trying to achieve, and the underlying data provider of the dataset itself. This section covers the different endpoints that allow you to modify a dataset, their details, and helps you pick the option that best fits your scenario. We recommend reviewing all of them before proceeding, so you can find the endpoint that best matches your needs.</p>

<h3 id="updating-the-fields-of-a-dataset">Updating the fields of a dataset</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Example request for updating the name of a dataset</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X PATCH https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/&lt;dataset-id-or-slug&gt; <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your-token&gt;"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -d <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="s1">'{
    "name": "Another name for the dataset"
}'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In order to modify the fields of a dataset, you can use the patch dataset endpoint. 
This endpoint allows you to modify most of your dataset&rsquo;s details, like the name or publishing status, but can also be used to modify internal fields of a dataset, like <code class="prettyprint">connectorType</code>. 
When making these changes, be mindful that some of these fields are critical to the correct behavior of the dataset, and providing incorrect values may break your dataset. 
There are other endpoints documented in this page that allow you to perform certain update-like operations (ie. update data on a document-type dataset), so refer to those first before using this endpoint. 
Also important to keep in mind is the fact that this endpoint does not perform validation on things like <code class="prettyprint">connectorUrl</code>/<code class="prettyprint">sources</code> URLs.</p>

<p>All the fields in the <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset reference</a> can be modified, except the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">slug</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">userId</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">createdAt</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">updatedAt</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, certain fields have special behavior associated with them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">status</code> can only be modified by users with <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> role or by other microservices.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">taskId</code> and <code class="prettyprint">errorMessage</code> can only be modified by other microservices.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">published</code> can only be modified by users with <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> role.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">env</code> changes will not only affect the dataset, but also related widgets and layers. Refer to the PATCH <code class="prettyprint">/widget/change-environment/&lt;dataset id&gt;/&lt;env&gt;</code> and the the PATCH <code class="prettyprint">/layer/change-environment/&lt;dataset id&gt;/&lt;env&gt;</code> endpoints respectively for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>When passing new values for Object type fields, the new value will fully overwrite the previous one. It&rsquo;s up to you, as an API user, to build any merging logic into your application.</p>

<p>To perform this operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the dataset</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the dataset&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the dataset)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Use this endpoint when:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modifying the fields of a dataset, like name, and not the data itself.</li>
<li>Modifying the source of data for any dataset that&rsquo;s not document based (<code class="prettyprint">connectorType</code> values other than <code class="prettyprint">document</code>).</li>
<li>Making advanced changes to a dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these endpoints, you can add more data to an already existing dataset. They are exclusively available for document based datasets - you&rsquo;ll get a <code class="prettyprint">404</code> error if you use them on a dataset of a different type. You can either provide the URL for the file containing the data you wish to add, or simply provide that data in the body of your request, as a JSON object.</p>

<p>These process are asynchronous and not instantaneous. Immediately when triggered, these requests will cause the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">status</code> to be set to <code class="prettyprint">pending</code>, meaning you will not be able to issue new overwrite, concatenate or append requests. Once the request has been fully processed, the status will be automatically set to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code>. Depending on factors like API load or the size of the data being uploaded, this may take from a few minutes to a few hours to occur. The API does not issue any notification when the asynchronous operation is finished.</p>

<p>In order to perform these operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">overwrite</code> property must be set to <code class="prettyprint">true</code>.</li>
<li>the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">status</code> property must be set to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code>.</li>
<li>the user must be logged in and match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> and belong to the same application as the dataset</li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the dataset&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the dataset)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>While they ultimately achieve a very similar end result, concatenate and append rely on different internal processes, each with its own characteristics.</p>

<ul>
<li>The concatenate process relies on a slower approach to ensure the operation is atomic. Until the operation is completed, you will see the dataset data as it was before the concatenate operation was triggered. If the operation fails, the old version of the data is kept accessible as it was before the concatenation process was started. There&rsquo;s a known issue where concatenating new data to already existing large datasets may result in failure.</li>
<li>The append operation relies on a faster process that does not offer atomicity. The new data is simply added to the current dataset, and any queries done while this process is taking place may produce results based on the preexisting data mixed with parts of the newly added values. Should the operation fail halfway, your dataset may contain all the preexisting records as well as part (but not all) of the newly added ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this endpoint, you can add or completely replace the data of an already existing dataset. 
It&rsquo;s exclusively available for document based datasets - you&rsquo;ll get a <code class="prettyprint">404</code> error if you use it on a dataset of a different type. 
All previously existing data will be permanently deleted. 
You can either provide the URL(s) for the file(s) containing the data you wish to add, or simply provide that data in the body of your request, as a JSON object. 
There are no requirements regarding similarity of the data structure between existing and new data - your overwrite data can have a completely different data schema.</p>

<p>This process is asynchronous and not instantaneous. Immediately when triggered, this request will cause the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">status</code> to be set to <code class="prettyprint">pending</code>, meaning you will not be able to issue new overwrite or concat requests, and will not yet be able to access the new data yet.

Other use cases could be converting the result of an analysis endpoint into a dataset, or capturing the result of a query to a REST based dataset (cartodb, arcgis, etc) to an internal json representation of the same data, that is kept in the API database.   </p>

<p>In order to perform this operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user must belong to the applications specified in the request body.</li>
<li>the user must be logged in and match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the dataset&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the dataset)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The request requires two fields to be present:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">datasetUrl</code>: the URL from where to load the data to populate the new dataset. Must be RW API, relative path, like <code class="prettyprint">/query/5306fd54-df71-4e20-8b34-2ff464ab28be?sql=select%20%2A%20from%20data%20limit%2010</code>.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">application</code>: the array of applications to which the new dataset will belong.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you can optionally specify these fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">legend</code>: field structure and type of the new dataset. Refer to <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset reference</a> for more details.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">applicationConfig</code>: application-specific configuration. Refer to <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset reference</a> for more details. If not provided, it will be copied from the original dataset.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">published</code>: if the user has <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> role, they can set this value to <code class="prettyprint">true</code>. </li>
</ul>

<p>For the fields in the following list, values will be copied from the original dataset to the new one, unless specified:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">name</code>: copied from the original dataset, with a timestamp appended, to ensure uniqueness.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">subtitle</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">dataPath</code>: will always be set to <code class="prettyprint">data</code>, matching the expected response structure of RW API responses like <code class="prettyprint">/query</code> that encapsulate the &quot;real&rdquo; data in a <code class="prettyprint">data</code> json object.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">connectorType</code>: will be set to <code class="prettyprint">document</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">provider</code>: will be set to <code class="prettyprint">json</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">attributesPath</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">tableName</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">dataLastUpdated</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">overwrite</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">published</code>: if the user has role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> and does not explicitly set <code class="prettyprint">published</code> to <code class="prettyprint">true</code> on the request body, this value is inherited. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s set to <code class="prettyprint">false</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Datasets created through a cloning operation will have a specific <code class="prettyprint">clonedHost</code> object, with additional data. Refer to <a href="#dataset-reference">dataset reference</a> for more details on the content of this field. </p>

<p>The dataset cloning requests accepts an optional <code class="prettyprint">full</code> boolean query parameter that, when set to <code class="prettyprint">true</code>, will clone of vocabulary-related data and metadata from the original dataset to the new one.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-a-dataset">Deleting a dataset</h2>

<p>Use this endpoint if you wish to delete a dataset. Deleting a dataset of type document (<code class="prettyprint">connectorType</code> with value <code class="prettyprint">document</code>) will cause the API&rsquo;s internal copy of said data to be deleted. Dataset types that proxy data from an external source (ie. carto, gee, etc) will be deleted without modifying said external source.</p>

<p>When deleting a dataset that is associated with multiple <code class="prettyprint">application</code> values, the user issuing the request must be associated with all of them in order for the dataset to be deleted. If that&rsquo;s not the case, the <code class="prettyprint">application</code> values associated with the user will be removed from the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">application</code> list, and no further action will be taken - the dataset itself and its associated resources will continue to exist. The dataset is only actually deleted if the user has access to all of the <code class="prettyprint">application</code> to which the dataset belongs. </p>

<p>Besides deleting the dataset itself, this endpoint also deletes graph vocabularies, layers, widgets and metadata related to the dataset itself. These delete operations are issued in this order, and prior to deleting the dataset itself, but are not atomic - if one of them fails (for example, if attempting to delete a protected resource), the following ones are canceled, but the already deleted elements are not restored. </p>

<p>In order to delete a dataset, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">protected</code> property must be set to <code class="prettyprint">false</code>.</li>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the dataset</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the dataset&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the dataset)</li>

<p>Certain datasets contain data that evolves frequently over time, and you, as the creator of this dataset, what to ensure that it&rsquo;s up-to-date. As we&rsquo;ve seen before, if your data is hosted on one of the supported 3rd party data providers, like Carto or Arcgis, your data will be proxied, so users of the RW API will always see the latest version of your data. However, if you uploaded your data from a file, your data is copied to the RW API database at the time of the dataset&rsquo;s creation, so keeping it up-to-date requires a different approach. It&rsquo;s with scenario in mind that the RW API offers the automatic synchronization mechanism.</p>

<p>The automatic synchronization mechanism is available for document based datasets only, and you can configure it when <a href="#creating-a-dataset">creating</a> or <a href="#updating-the-fields-of-a-dataset">updating</a> a dataset. When enabled, it will schedule an automatic, periodic task, that will update your document based dataset&rsquo;s data, based on data from an URL you provide. This means that, once configured, you just have to make sure the automatic synchronization mechanism can find the newest version of the data at the specified URL, and the RW API will take care of the actual data update process for you.</p>

<p>To configure automatic synchronization on dataset creation or update, you need to pass a <code class="prettyprint">sync</code> object on your calls to the respective endpoints, next to the other fields. See the included example for a clearer idea of how creating a dataset with automatic synchronization looks like.</p>

<p>There are 3 fields, all required, that you need to specify inside the <code class="prettyprint">sync</code> object:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">action</code>: choose either <code class="prettyprint">concat</code> or <code class="prettyprint">overwrite</code>. See more details above about <a href="#concatenate-and-append-data-to-a-document-based-dataset">concatenating</a> and <a href="#overwrite-data-for-a-document-based-dataset">overwriting</a> dataset data. Append operations, as documented in the section above, is not supported.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">cronPattern</code>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> expression representing when and how frequently the synchronization process should take place. The host executing these tasks use UTC timezone.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">url</code>: publicly available URL from where the automatic synchronization mechanism will load the data to replace/concatenate to your dataset. </li>
</ul>

<p>Internally, the automatic synchronization mechanism will call either the <a href="#concatenate-and-append-data-to-a-document-based-dataset">dataset concatenation</a> or <a href="#overwrite-data-for-a-document-based-dataset">dataset overwrite</a> endpoint. 
If that internal request fails - for example, if <code class="prettyprint">overwrite</code> is set to <code class="prettyprint">false</code> - the sync process will fail silently. 
If you have the <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> role, you can use the <code class="prettyprint">/v1/task</code> endpoint to see scheduled tasks and their error output, but otherwise this failure will be invisible to end users.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the request goes through, but the concatenation/overwrite process fails - for example, if the URL provided is not available - then your dataset <code class="prettyprint">status</code> will be set to <code class="prettyprint">error</code> and the <code class="prettyprint">errorMessage</code> field will give you a simple description of what happened.</p>

<p>To see the details (including the date) of the last operation performed on the dataset, use the link in the <code class="prettyprint">taskId</code> field.</p>

          <h1 id="query">Query</h1>

<p>In order to retrieve data from datasets, you can send queries to the API using a syntax very similar to SQL. Using these endpoints, you can also download the results of a particular query. If you are new to the RW API, or want to learn more about the concept of a querying datasets, we strongly encourage you to read the <a href="#query">query concept</a> documentation first. It gives you a brief and clear description of what a query is, and what it is useful for.</p>

<p><em>Please note that some SQL features might not be supported. Check <a href="index-rw.html#supported-sql-syntax-reference">here</a> for a reference of the SQL features&rsquo; support for each dataset provider.</em></p>

<h2 id="querying-datasets">Querying datasets</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Structure of the endpoint for executing a query:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/&lt;dataset.id&gt;?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt;'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In order to query a dataset, you&rsquo;ll need two pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The id of the dataset you&rsquo;re trying to query.</li>
<li>The SQL query that represents the data you are trying to retrieve.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#dataset6">dataset documentation</a> covers different ways that you can use to browse the existing dataset catalog or upload your own, all of which will give you the details of a dataset, including the dataset id you&rsquo;ll need to query it.</p>

<p>The SQL query will have to be custom built by you to fit your needs, but a good starting point for newcomers would be something like <code class="prettyprint">SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt; limit 10</code>.</p>

<p><em>Notice: the <code class="prettyprint">limit</code> parameter restricts our results to 10 rows, and is not required. However, for our learning purposes, this is useful, as it keeps the API responses small and fast.</em></p>

<p>Most of the SQL query is up to you to define, based on your needs and the <a href="#supported-sql-syntax-reference">support provided for the dataset type you are using</a>. The <code class="prettyprint">FROM</code> clause, however, does use a special value - the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">tableName</code> value, which you can also get from the <a href="#dataset6">dataset documentation</a> described above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example endpoint for executing a query:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM gadm28_adm1 limit 10'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With both pieces of information at hand, you can now send your query to the API and get the response. The example <code class="prettyprint">cURL</code> to the side shows how that would look like.</p>

<p>Example query providing a geostore id as query parameter to filter the results:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/1d7085f7-11c7-4eaf-a29a-5a4de57d010e?sql=SELECT * FROM dis_001_significant_earthquakes LIMIT 5&amp;geostore=972c24e1da2c2baacc7572ee9501abdc'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Some dataset providers support receiving a <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> query parameter. When providing this parameter, you can request geo-referenced data that fits within the bounding box of the geostore with id provided. You can obtain the id of the geostore using the <a href="#geostore">RW API Geostore API</a>. If the data is not geo-referenced, or if the dataset provider does not support the <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> query parameter, it will be ignored.</p>

<p>The following providers support this parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>CartoDB (<code class="prettyprint">carto</code>)</li>
<li>ArcGIS (<code class="prettyprint">featureservice</code>)</li>

<h3 id="alternative-ways-for-querying-datasets">Alternative ways for querying datasets</h3>

<p>While the GET request described above is the recommended way of querying datasets, there are other ways to query the RW API datasets that may be more suited for specific use cases.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-dataset-slug-instead-of-the-id">Using the dataset slug instead of the id</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Example query not using the dataset id in the request path, and using the dataset slug in the FROM clause:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/Glad-Alerts-Daily-Geostore-User-Areas_3?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When referencing a dataset&rsquo;s id in a query, you have the option to use the dataset&rsquo;s slug instead, obtaining the same result. This is also applicable to the alternative query methods described in the sections below.</p>

<h4 id="post-requests">POST requests</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The same query executed as GET, and as a POST request providing the SQL as request body param:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
curl -i -X POST <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s1">'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-d <span class="s1">'{
    "sql": "SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2"
}'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Using the GET request is the recommended approach, as it allows HTTP caching of your result - subsequent requests for the same query will see a great performance increase, even if they are made by a different application or client.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also query a dataset using a POST request. POST requests are not cached, so you will not benefit from these speed improvements. However, GET requests can sometimes hit URL length restrictions, should your query string be too long. Using a POST request is the recommended solution for these cases. See the example on the side to see how you can query a dataset with a POST request.</p>

<h4 id="dataset-id-as-the-from-clause">Dataset id as the FROM clause</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Three different but equivalent syntaxes for the same query:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM gadm28_adm1 limit 10'</span>

curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM 098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a limit 10'</span>

curl -i -X POST <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s1">'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-d <span class="s1">'{
    "sql": "SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM 098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a limit 10"
}'</span>

</code></pre>
<p>The examples we&rsquo;ve seen so far expect the URL to have the <code class="prettyprint">/query/&lt;dataset id or slug&gt;?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt;</code> format. However, you can also use the equivalent
<code class="prettyprint">/query?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset id&gt;</code> syntax. You can also use this alternative syntax with POST requests.</p>

<h4 id="redundant-from-clause-document-based-datasets-only">Redundant FROM clause (document based datasets only)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Example query providing a document-based dataset id in the request path or as the FROM clause:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query?sql=SELECT alert__date FROM 9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e limit 10'</span>
curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date FROM data limit 10'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When querying a document based dataset using either GET or POST <code class="prettyprint">/query/&lt;dataset id or slug&gt;</code> request, the <code class="prettyprint">FROM</code> clause is required but ignored, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to provide the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">tableName</code> as you normally would. The example on the side illustrates this.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/&lt;dataset.id&gt;?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt;'</span>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM gadm28_adm1 limit 10'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The download endpoint allows you to download the results of the execution of a query over a dataset. This endpoint is greatly based on the <a href="index-rw.html#querying-datasets">query datasets</a> endpoint, so we strongly suggest you read that section of the documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Some dataset providers do not support downloading query results. You can download query results for the following dataset providers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Google Earth Engine</li>
<li>Document-based datasets</li>
<li>Carto</li>
<li>BigQuery</li>
<li>ArcGIS FeatureService</li>
</ul>

<p>Like when querying datasets, in order to download the results of the execution of query, you&rsquo;ll need two pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The id of the dataset you&rsquo;re trying to download the query execution results.</li>
<li>The SQL query that represents the data you are trying to download.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#dataset6">dataset documentation</a> covers different ways that you can use to browse the existing dataset catalog or upload your own, all of which will give you the details of a dataset, including the dataset id you&rsquo;ll need to query it.</p>

<p>The SQL query will have to be custom built by you to fit your needs, but a good starting point for newcomers would be something like <code class="prettyprint">SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt; limit 10</code>.</p>

<p><em>Notice: the <code class="prettyprint">limit</code> parameter restricts our results to 10 rows, and is not required. However, for our learning purposes, this is useful, as it keeps the API responses small and fast.</em></p>

<p>As with the query endpoint, the <code class="prettyprint">FROM</code> clause should reference the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">tableName</code> value, which you can also get from the <a href="#dataset6">dataset documentation</a> described above. And also, don&rsquo;t forget that you can check the <a href="#supported-sql-syntax-reference">support provided for the dataset type you are using</a> if you are having trouble writing your SQL query.</p>

When providing this parameter, you can request geo-referenced data that fits within the bounding box of the geostore with id provided. You can obtain the id of the geostore using the <a href="index-rw.html#geostore">RW API Geostore API</a>. If the data is not geo-referenced, or if the dataset provider does not support the <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> query parameter, it will be ignored.</p>

<p>The following providers support this parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>CartoDB (<code class="prettyprint">carto</code>)</li>
<li>ArcGIS (<code class="prettyprint">featureservice</code>)</li>
<li>Google Earth Engine (<code class="prettyprint">gee</code>)</li>
<li>BigQuery (<code class="prettyprint">bigquery</code>)</li>
<li>Rasdaman (<code class="prettyprint">rasdaman</code>)</li>
<li>NEX-GDDP (<code class="prettyprint">nexgddp</code>)</li>
<li>Loca (<code class="prettyprint">loca</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-ways-for-downloading-query-execution-results">Alternative ways for downloading query execution results</h3>

<p>As in the case of <a href="index-rw.html#alternative-ways-for-querying-datasets">querying datasets</a>, there are some alternative ways that you can use for downloading query execution results. While the GET request described above is the recommended way of downloading query results, there are other ways to download query results that may be more suited for specific use cases.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-dataset-slug-instead-of-the-id">Using the dataset slug instead of the id</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Example request for downloading the query execution results not using the dataset id in the request path, and using the dataset slug in the FROM clause:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/Glad-Alerts-Daily-Geostore-User-Areas_3?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When referencing a dataset&rsquo;s id in th SQL query, you have the option to use the dataset&rsquo;s slug instead, obtaining the same result. This is also applicable to the alternative download methods described in the sections below.</p>

<h4 id="post-requests">POST requests</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The same download request executed as GET, and as a POST request providing the SQL as request body param:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2'</span>
curl -i -X POST <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s1">'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-d <span class="s1">'{
    "sql": "SELECT alert__date from gadm28_adm1 limit 2"
}'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Using the GET request is the recommended approach, as it allows HTTP caching of your result - subsequent requests for the same download endpoint call will see a great performance increase, even if they are made by a different application or client.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also download the query results using a POST request. POST requests are not cached, so you will not benefit from these speed improvements. However, GET requests can sometimes hit URL length restrictions, should your SQL query string be too long. Using a POST request is the recommended solution for these cases. See the example on the side to see how you can download the query execution results with a POST request.</p>

<h4 id="dataset-id-as-the-from-clause">Dataset id as the FROM clause</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Three different but equivalent syntaxes for the same call to the download endpoint:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM gadm28_adm1 limit 10'</span>

curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download?sql=SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM 098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a limit 10'</span>

curl -i -X POST <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s1">'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-d <span class="s1">'{
    "sql": "SELECT cartodb_id, iso, name_0, name_1, type_1 FROM 098b33df-6871-4e53-a5ff-b56a7d989f9a limit 10"
}'</span>

</code></pre>
<p>The examples we&rsquo;ve seen so far expect the URL to have the <code class="prettyprint">/download/&lt;dataset id or slug&gt;?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset.tableName&gt;</code> format. However, you can also use the equivalent <code class="prettyprint">/download?sql=SELECT * FROM &lt;dataset id&gt;</code> syntax. This alternative syntax is also available for POST requests.</p>

<h4 id="redundant-from-clause-document-based-datasets-only">Redundant FROM clause (document-based datasets only)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Example download providing a document-based dataset id in the request path or as the FROM clause:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download?sql=SELECT alert__date FROM 9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e limit 10'</span>
curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/download/9be3bf63-97fc-4bb0-b913-775ccae3cf9e?sql=SELECT alert__date FROM data limit 10'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When downloading the query results for a document based dataset using either GET or POST <code class="prettyprint">/download/&lt;dataset id or slug&gt;</code> request, the <code class="prettyprint">FROM</code> clause is required but ignored, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to provide the dataset&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">tableName</code> as you normally would. The example on the side illustrates this.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-data-from-a-dataset">Deleting data from a dataset</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Example requests to delete data from a dataset:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/:dataset_id?sql=DELETE FROM index_bf86b945c4ec41d2b5b7af00f3f61423'</span>
curl -i -X GET <span class="s1">'https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/query/:dataset_id?sql=DELETE FROM index_bf86b945c4ec41d2b5b7af00f3f61423 WHERE x = "y"'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Write queries such as <code class="prettyprint">INSERT</code> or <code class="prettyprint">UPDATE</code> are not supported in the RW API. You can use dataset endpoints to <a href="index-rw.html#concatenate-and-append-data-to-a-document-based-dataset">append</a> or <a href="index-rw.html#overwrite-data-for-a-document-based-dataset">overwrite</a> a given dataset&rsquo;s data, but you cannot use SQL to write data into the datasets.</p>

<p>Most providers do not support <code class="prettyprint">DELETE</code> queries either. However, in the case of <strong>document-based datasets</strong> (i.e. where the <code class="prettyprint">connectorType</code> is <code class="prettyprint">document</code>), you can delete the dataset&rsquo;s data via SQL <code class="prettyprint">DELETE</code> query. Executing a <code class="prettyprint">DELETE</code> query requires authentication, and additionally, one of the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and own the dataset;</li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> and belong to all the apps to which the dataset is associated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the query is successfully executed, the request will return an HTTP response with status code <code class="prettyprint">204 No Content</code>. Please note that executing a delete query is an <strong>asynchronous process</strong> - as in the case of appending or overwriting a dataset&rsquo;s data, the dataset will have its status updated to <code class="prettyprint">pending</code>, and updated once again to <code class="prettyprint">saved</code> once the deletion process is completed.</p>

<p>This section describes the SQL support for querying datasets with connector type <code class="prettyprint">document</code> and providers <code class="prettyprint">csv</code>, <code class="prettyprint">tsv</code>, <code class="prettyprint">json</code> or <code class="prettyprint">xml</code>.</p>

<p>While the API has it&rsquo;s own query handling mechanism, it mostly relies on <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/sql/">Opendistro for Elasticsearch 1.x SQL support</a>, meaning its limitations will also apply to queries done to document-based datasets.</p>

<h4 id="troubleshooting-sql-queries-for-document-based-datasets">Troubleshooting SQL queries for document-based datasets</h4>

<p>This SQL syntax supported when running queries for document-based datasets has some known limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very large SQL queries may run into some parsing issues.</li>
<li>Sorting by aggregated fields is not supported. For instance, the following statement is <strong>not</strong> supported: <code class="prettyprint">GROUP BY age ORDER BY COUNT(*)</code>.</li>
<li>Using aggregation functions on top of scalar functions is also not possible. For instance, the following statement is <strong>not</strong> supported: <code class="prettyprint">SELECT MAX(abs(age))</code>.</li>
<li>Sub-queries are only supported to a small degree, but the usage of <code class="prettyprint">GROUP BY</code> or <code class="prettyprint">HAVING</code> in the sub-query is not supported. For instance, the following statement <strong>is</strong> supported: <code class="prettyprint">SELECT * FROM (SELECT first_name, last_name FROM emp WHERE last_name NOT LIKE &#39;%a%&#39;) WHERE first_name LIKE &#39;A%&#39; ORDER BY 1</code>, but statements with a higher level of complexity than applying simple conditions or orderings in the sub-query might not be supported.</li>
<li>The usage of scalar functions on nested fields in <code class="prettyprint">ORDER BY</code> or <code class="prettyprint">WHERE</code> clauses is limited. For instance, the following statement is <strong>not</strong> supported: <code class="prettyprint">ORDER BY YEAR(dep.start_date)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like with the other supported providers, you can use a SQL-like syntax to query datasets stored both in NASA NEX-GDDP or in Loca. However, these datasets always contain geo-referenced data, and so they expect that you always provide either a <code class="prettyprint">lat</code> + <code class="prettyprint">lon</code> pair, or a <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> id, in order to filter the returned data. If you don&rsquo;t provide either a geostore id or a lat+lon pair, the request will fail with status code <code class="prettyprint">400 Bad Request</code>, with the following message: <code class="prettyprint">No coordinates provided. Include geostore or lat &amp; lon</code>.</p>

<p>The examples on the side allow you to understand how you can provide either the <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> id or the <code class="prettyprint">lat</code> + <code class="prettyprint">lon</code> combination.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-layer">What is a layer?</h2>

<p>By now, you are probably already familiar with <a href="#dataset">datasets</a> and <a href="#query">querying</a> them (if you are not, now is a good time to get up to speed on those). Many of the datasets you&rsquo;ll find on the RW API - and perhaps the datasets you are uploading too - contain georeferenced information. If that&rsquo;s the case, then you may want to render your data as a web map layer, and the RW API&rsquo;s <em>layer</em> endpoints can help you with that.</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in the <a href="#layer">layer concept docs</a>, a RW API layer may store data in different formats, depending on the needs of its author. This is done using the several open format fields a layer has. To keep this documentation easy to understand, we&rsquo;ll spit our approach to layers into two sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll first discuss the details of the endpoints that allow you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> layers, without focusing on the actual data contained in it.</li>
<li>In an future version of these docs, we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into some of the most common structures used to store data in the layer&rsquo;s open format fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>After viewing the documentation below, consider looking at the <a href="https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/tutorials.html#mapbox-webmap-quickstart">webmap tutorial</a> for a step-by-step guide to rendering an actual layer on a web application.</p>

The result is a paginated list of 10 layers, followed by metadata on total number of layers and pages, as well as useful pagination links. By default, only layers with <code class="prettyprint">env</code> value <code class="prettyprint">production</code> are displayed. In the sections below, we’ll explore how you can customize this endpoint call to match your needs.</p>

<p>When handling layers, it&rsquo;s common to want to limit results to those layers associated with a given dataset. Besides the <a href="#filters132">filters</a> covered below, there&rsquo;s an additional convenience endpoint to get the layers associated with a dataset, as shown in this example. </p>

<p>Besides the required <code class="prettyprint">ids</code> array, your request body may optionally include a <code class="prettyprint">app</code> string value if you&rsquo;d like to filter the returned layers by their <code class="prettyprint">application</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a single value, like <code class="prettyprint">rw</code>, if you want to show only layers that have <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> as one of their applications. </li>
<li>Use a comma separated list, like <code class="prettyprint">rw,prep</code>, if you want to show only layers that have <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> or <code class="prettyprint">prep</code> as one of their applications.</li>
<li>Use a @ separated list, like <code class="prettyprint">rw@prep</code>, if you want to show only layers that have both <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> and <code class="prettyprint">prep</code> as their applications.</li>
<li>Note that the the filters do not need to match on the full application list. For example, the filters <code class="prettyprint">rw,prep</code> and <code class="prettyprint">rw@prep</code> will both match a layer with the application list <code class="prettyprint">[&quot;rw&quot;, &quot;prep&quot;, &quot;gfw&quot;]</code>.</li>

<p>By default, layers are listed in pages of 10 layers each, and the first page is loaded. However, you can customize this behavior using the following query parameters:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Custom pagination: load page 2 using 25 results per page</p>

<p>The layer list endpoints provide a wide range of filters that you can use to tailor your layer listing. The great majority of the layer fields you&rsquo;ll find on the <a href="#layer-reference">layer reference</a> section can be used as filters when listing layers, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">id</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">userName</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">userRole</code>: filtering by the role of the owning user can be done using the <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> query argument. If the requesting user does not have the ADMIN role, this filter is ignored.</li>
<li>Filtering by fields of type <code class="prettyprint">Object</code> is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you can use the following filters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">collection</code>: filters by a <a href="#collections">collection</a> id. Requires being authenticated.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">favourite</code>: if defined, only the layers set by the user as <a href="#favorites">favorites</a> will be returned. Requires being authenticated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple parameters can be combined into a complex <code class="prettyprint">and</code> logic filter. Depending on the type of the field you&rsquo;re filtering by, the following behavior is available:</p>

<ul>
<li>String type fields support both regular expressions and partial matches.</li>
<li>Array type fields support <code class="prettyprint">,</code> as <code class="prettyprint">OR</code> and <code class="prettyprint">@</code> as <code class="prettyprint">AND</code> separators for multiple values.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>

<p>The API currently supports sorting by means of the <code class="prettyprint">sort</code> parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the layer, as well as <code class="prettyprint">user.name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> (sorting by user data is restricted to ADMIN users).</p>

<p>Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorting layers</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/layer?sort=name"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorting layers by multiple criteria</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/layer?sort=name,slug"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either <code class="prettyprint">-</code> for descending order or <code class="prettyprint">+</code> for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explicit order of sorting</p>

<h3 id="include-entities-associated-with-the-layers">Include entities associated with the layers</h3>

<p>When fetching layers, you can request additional entities to be loaded. The following entities are available:</p>

<p>Loads all vocabulary entities associated with each layer.

There&rsquo;s currently no way to modify this behavior.</p>

<h4 id="user">User</h4>

<p>Loads the name and email address of the author of the layer. If you request this issue as an authenticated user with <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> role, you will additionally get the author&rsquo;s role.</p>

<p>If the data is not available (for example, the user has since been deleted), no <code class="prettyprint">user</code> property will be added to the layer object.</p>

<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll guide you through the process of creating a layer in the RW API. Layer creation is available to all registered API users, and will allow you to store your own layer visualisation settings on the API, for reusing and sharing.</p>

<p>Before creating a layer, there are a few things you must know and do:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to be able to create a layer, you need to be <a href="#authentication">authenticated</a>.</li>
<li>Depending on your user account&rsquo;s role, you may have permission to create a layer but not delete it afterwards.</li>
<li>The layers you create on the RW API will be publicly visible and available to other users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a layer is done using a POST request and passing the relevant data as body fields. The supported body fields are as defined on the <a href="#layer-reference">layer reference</a> section, but the minimum field list you must specify for all layers is:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>description </li>
<li>application</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a dependency on a dataset id, as it is required to build the POST URL. As noted on the <a href="#layer">layer concept</a> documentation, a layer is meant to hold the rendering details of a layer, but not the actual data - that should be part of the dataset. While this is not enforced - it&rsquo;s up to your rendering tool to load the data, and it can do it from a RW API dataset or from anywhere else - it&rsquo;s common and best practice to have the data for a layer be sourced from the dataset that&rsquo;s associated with it.</p>

<p>When a layer is created, a <a href="#vocabulary-and-tags">vocabulary tag</a> for it is automatically created, associated with the dataset tag.</p>

<p>The layer service was built to be very flexible, and not be restricted to specific layer rendering libraries or tools. This gives you the freedom to use virtually any rendering technology you want, but it also means you&rsquo;ll have to make additional decisions on how to structure your data into the different open format fields provided by a RW API layer. In a future release of these docs, we&rsquo;ll show you some examples of how existing applications use different rendering tools with the layer endpoints, to give you an idea on how you can structure your own data, and also as a way to help you get started creating your first layers for your own custom applications. Until then, the <a href="https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/tutorials.html">tutorials section of the documentation</a> shows an example of how existing raster tile layers may be structured and how the information in the layer response can be utilized by a third-party visualization library.</p>

<p>Example PATCH request that updates a layer&rsquo;s name:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X PATCH <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/&lt;dataset_id&gt;/layer/&lt;layer_id&gt;"</span> <span class="se">\</span>

</code></pre>
<p>The update layer endpoint allows you to modify the details of an existing layer. As noted on the <a href="#layer">layer concept</a> documentation, the layer object stores the details of how layer is meant to be rendered, but does not contain the actual data. As such, if you are looking to update the data that&rsquo;s being displayed on your map, this is probably not the endpoint you&rsquo;re looking for - you may want to <a href="#updating-a-dataset">update your dataset</a> instead. Use this endpoint if you want to modify things like legend details, color schemes, etc - this will depend on your rendering implementation. </p>

<p>Unless specified otherwise in their description, all the fields present in the <a href="#layer-reference">layer reference</a> section can be updated using this endpoint. When passing new values for Object type fields, the new value will fully overwrite the previous one. It’s up to you, as an API user, to build any merging logic into your application.</p>

<p>To perform this operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the layer</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the layer&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the layer)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Use this endpoint if you&rsquo;d like to delete a layer from the RW API. As a layer object does not store the actual data being displayed, this will only delete the layer settings, but the actual data will continue to be available at its source.</p>

<p>Besides deleting the layer itself, this endpoint also deletes graph vocabularies and metadata related to the layer itself. These delete operations are issued after the layer itself is deleted. The process is not atomic, and the output of the API request is based solely on the result of the deletion of the layer itself. For example, is the metadata service is temporarily unavailable when you issue your delete layer request, the layer itself will be deleted, but the associated metadata will continue to exist. The response will not reflect the failure to delete metadata in any way.</p>

<p>In order to delete a layer, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the layer&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">protected</code> property must be set to <code class="prettyprint">false</code>.</li>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the layer.</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the layer&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the layer)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>This section gives you a complete view at the properties that are maintained as part of layer.

<h2 id="what-is-a-widget">What is a widget?</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, a RW API widget is a toolset to help you render your data in a visually more appealing way. The <a href="#widget">widget concept documentation</a> will give you a more detailed description of this, and we encourage you to read it before proceeding. We also recommend you take a look at our section about <a href="#widget-configuration-using-vega-grammar">Vega</a> if you plan on reusing existing widgets or uploading widgets that are reusable by other users. The RW API does not require you to use Vega, but we highly recommend that you do, as it&rsquo;s the technology used by many of the widgets you&rsquo;ll find on the RW API.</p>

<p>Besides the required <code class="prettyprint">ids</code> array, your request body may optionally include a <code class="prettyprint">app</code> string value if you&rsquo;d like to filter the returned widgets by their <code class="prettyprint">application</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a single value, like <code class="prettyprint">rw</code>, if you want to show only widgets that have <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> as one of their applications. </li>
<li>Use a comma separated list, like <code class="prettyprint">rw,prep</code>, if you want to show only widgets that have <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> or <code class="prettyprint">prep</code> as one of their applications.</li>
<li>Note that the the filters do not need to match on the full application list. For example, the filters <code class="prettyprint">rw,prep</code> and <code class="prettyprint">rw@prep</code> will both match a widget with the application list <code class="prettyprint">[&quot;rw&quot;, &quot;prep&quot;, &quot;gfw&quot;]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that, unlike <a href="#getting-all-widgets">getting all widgets</a> or <a href="#getting-all-widgets-for-a-dataset">getting all widgets for a dataset</a>, this endpoint does not come with paginated results, nor does it support <a href="#pagination134">pagination</a>, <a href="#filters135">filtering</a> or <a href="#sorting136">sorting</a> or <a href="#include-related-entities137">including related entities</a> described in their respective sections.</p>

<p>The widget list endpoints provide a wide range of filters that you can use to tailor your widget listing. The great majority of the widget fields you&rsquo;ll find on the <a href="#widget-reference">widget reference</a> section can be used as filters when listing widgets, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">id</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">userName</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">userRole</code>: filtering by the role of the owning user can be done using the <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> query argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you can use the following filters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">collection</code>: filters by a <a href="#collections">collection</a> id. Requires being authenticated.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">favourite</code>: if any value is defined for this query param, only the widgets set by the user as <a href="#favorites">favorites</a> will be returned. Requires being authenticated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple parameters can be combined into a complex <code class="prettyprint">and</code> logic filter. Depending on the type of the field you&rsquo;re filtering by, the following behavior is available:</p>

<ul>
<li>String type fields support both regular expressions and partial matches.</li>
<li>Array type fields support <code class="prettyprint">,</code> as <code class="prettyprint">OR</code> and <code class="prettyprint">@</code> as <code class="prettyprint">AND</code> separators for multiple values.</li>
<li>Object type fields will match the whole object, not just its parts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>

<p>The API currently supports sorting by means of the <code class="prettyprint">sort</code> parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the widget, as well as <code class="prettyprint">user.name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> (sorting by user data is restricted to <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> users).</p>

<p>Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorting widgets</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.</p>

<p>Sorting widgets by multiple criteria</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/widget?sort=name,slug"</span>

<p>You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either <code class="prettyprint">-</code> for descending order or <code class="prettyprint">+</code> for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.</p>

<p>When getting a single widget, you can optionally provide a <code class="prettyprint">queryUrl</code> query parameter. If provided, this parameter will overwrite the following response values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.queryUrl</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.widgetConfig.data.url</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.widgetConfig.data[0].url</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This overwrite will only happen if a previous value already existed for the respective field. Also, keep in mind that these changes will NOT be persisted to the database, and will only affect the current request&rsquo;s response. </p>

<p>When getting a single widget, you can optionally provide additional custom query parameter. These parameters will be appended to the following response values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.queryUrl</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.widgetConfig.data.url</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">data.attributes.widgetConfig.data[0].url</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The widget service assumes these values are URLs, and will append your custom query parameters as such:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the value already has a <code class="prettyprint">?</code> character present, your custom query parameters will be appended with <code class="prettyprint">&amp;</code> preceding them. </li>
<li>If no <code class="prettyprint">?</code> is present, the first custom query parameter will be appended with a <code class="prettyprint">?</code>, and the following with a <code class="prettyprint">&amp;</code> before them.</li>
</ul>

<p>This overwrite will only happen if a previous value already existed for the respective field. Also, keep in mind that these changes will NOT be persisted to the database, and will only affect the current request&rsquo;s response. You can combine these custom query parameters with an <a href="#overwrite-the-query-url-of-a-widget-response">overwritten query url</a>, as seen on the included example.</p>

<h3 id="include-entities-associated-with-the-widget">Include entities associated with the widget</h3>

<p>You can load related <code class="prettyprint">user</code>, <code class="prettyprint">vocabulary</code> and <code class="prettyprint">metadata</code> data in the same request. See <a href="#include-entities-associated-with-the-widgets">this section</a> for more details.</p>

<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll guide you through the process of creating a widget in the RW API. Widget creation is available to all registered API users, and will allow you to store your own widget visualisation settings on the API, for reusing and sharing.</p>

<p>Before creating a widget, there are a few things you must know and do:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to be able to create a widget, you need to be <a href="#authentication">authenticated</a>.</li>
<li>Depending on your user account&rsquo;s role, you may have permission to create a widget but not delete it afterwards.</li>
<li>The widgets you create on the RW API will be publicly visible and available to other users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a widget is done using a POST request and passing the relevant data as body files. The supported body fields are as defined on the <a href="#widget-reference">widget reference</a> section, but the minimum field list you must specify for all widgets is:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>application</li>
<li>dataset - which can be specified either through the URL or the POST body.</li>
</ul>

<p>The widget service was built to be very flexible, and not be restricted to specific widget rendering libraries or tools. While we recommend using <a href="#widget-configuration-using-vega-grammar">Vega</a>, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide which library to use, and how to save your custom data within a widget&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code> field. While there is no hard limit on this, widgets that rely on excessively large <code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code> objects have been known to cause issues, so we recommend being mindful of this.</p>

<h4 id="widget-thumbnails">Widget thumbnails</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Preview of the thumbnail of a widget</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://resourcewatch.org/embed/widget/&lt;widget_id&gt;"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When a widget is created or updated, the RW API will automatically try to generate a thumbnail preview of it. This is done using the renderer that&rsquo;s part of the <a href="https://resourcewatch.org">Resource Watch</a> website, and will only produce a thumbnail if your widget uses the same approach as the RW website for declaring its widgets. Searching for widgets belonging to the <code class="prettyprint">rw</code> application will give you an idea of how this is achieved.</p>

<p>The thumbnail process is asynchronous, meaning it may take up to one minute for your newly created or updated widget to have a valid and/or up to date <code class="prettyprint">thumbnailUrl</code> value. If the thumbnail generation process fails (for example, if you decide to use a different rendering tool and data structure), the thumbnail generation will fail silently, but will not affect the actual widget creation or update process.</p>

<p>The update widget endpoint allows you to modify the details of an existing widget. As noted on the <a href="#widget">widget concept</a> documentation, the widget object stores the details of how widget is meant to be rendered, but may not contain the actual data. As such, if you are looking to update the data that&rsquo;s being displayed on your widget, this is probably not the endpoint you&rsquo;re looking for - you may want to <a href="#updating-a-dataset">update your dataset</a> instead. Use this endpoint if you want to modify things like legend details, color schemes, etc - this will depend on your rendering implementation. </p>

<p>Unless specified otherwise in their description, all the fields present in the <a href="#widget-reference">widget reference</a> section can be updated using this endpoint. When passing new values for Object type fields, like <code class="prettyprint">widgetConfig</code>, the new value will fully overwrite the previous one. It’s up to you, as an API user, to build any merging logic into your application.</p>

<p>To perform this operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the widget</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> or <code class="prettyprint">USER</code> and be the widget&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the widget) and belong to all the applications associated with the widget.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>When a widget is updated, a new thumbnail is generated. Refer to <a href="#widget-thumbnails">this section</a> for details on this process. </p>

<p>This endpoint allows you to duplicate an existing widget. The newly created widget is identical to the old one, except:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> will be the id of the user who issued the clone request</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">description</code> will be the same but can optionally be modified by the clone request (see the provided example)</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">createdAt</code> and <code class="prettyprint">updatedAt</code> will have the current time.</li>
</ul>

<p>To perform this operation, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the widget</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>

<p>Use this endpoint if you&rsquo;d like to delete a widget from the RW API. As a widget object may not store the actual data being displayed, this may only delete the widget settings, but the actual data may continue to be available at its source.</p>

<p>Besides deleting the widget itself, this endpoint also deletes graph vocabularies and metadata related to the widget itself. These delete operations are issued after the widget itself is deleted. The process is not atomic, and the response is based solely on the result of the deletion of the widget itself, not related resources. For example, is the metadata service is temporarily unavailable when you issue your delete widget request, the widget itself will be deleted, but the associated metadata will continue to exist. The response will not reflect the failure to delete metadata in any way.</p>

<p>In order to delete a widget, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the widget&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">protected</code> property must be set to <code class="prettyprint">false</code>.</li>
<li>the user must be logged in and belong to the same application as the widget.</li>
<li>the user must match one of the following:

<ul>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code></li>
<li>have role <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> and be the widget&rsquo;s owner (through the <code class="prettyprint">userId</code> field of the widget)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="widget-reference">Widget reference</h2>

<p>This section gives you a complete view at the properties that are maintained as part of widget. When interacting with a widget (on get, on create, etc) you will find most of these properties available to you, although they may be organized in a slightly different structure (ie: on get, everything but the <code class="prettyprint">id</code> is nested inside an <code class="prettyprint">attributes</code> object).</p>

<p>You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/resource-watch/widget/blob/master/app/src/models/widget.model.js">source code</a>.</p>

          <h1 id="metadata">Metadata</h1>

<h2 id="metadata-definition">Metadata definition</h2>

<p>Metadata is data concerning another resource available on this API. It only exists when associated with another resource - currently supported resource types are datasets, widgets or layers. Note that, although there might be several metadata per resource, each resource will have - at most - one metadata element per <code class="prettyprint">application</code> and <code class="prettyprint">language</code> pair. As such, the <code class="prettyprint">application</code> and <code class="prettyprint">language</code> attributes are required and it is mandatory to include them in when creating/updating metadata.</p>

<p>Some fields are important to identify the entity properly; others are just optional and give extra information about it.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-metadata-object">Creating a metadata object</h2>

<p>As previously discussed, a metadata entity is always associated with either a dataset, a widget or a layer resource, and the type of resource it is associated
to dictates which of 3 endpoints you should use when creating a new metadata entity.</p>

<p>In all scenarios, you must be authenticated to be able to create a metadata entity, and meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> or <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> role.</li>
<li>Belong to the same <code class="prettyprint">application</code> as the metadata being created. </li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these conditions are not met, the API will generate a 403 <code class="prettyprint">Forbidden</code> error message.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-a-metadata">Deleting a metadata</h2>

<p>As previously discussed, a metadata entity is always associated with either a dataset, a widget or a layer resource, and the type of resource it is associated
to dictates which of 3 endpoints you should use when deleting a metadata entity.</p>

<p>In all scenarios, you must be authenticated to be able to delete a metadata entity, and meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the <code class="prettyprint">ADMIN</code> or <code class="prettyprint">MANAGER</code> role.</li>
<li>Belong to the same <code class="prettyprint">application</code> as the metadata being created. </li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these conditions are not met, the API will generate a 403 <code class="prettyprint">Forbidden</code> error message.</p>

<p>When deleting a metadata, you must always specify both <code class="prettyprint">language</code> and <code class="prettyprint">application</code>, those will be used to determine which metadata entity will be deleted.</p>

          <h1 id="vocabulary-and-tags">Vocabulary (and Tags)</h1>

<h2 id="resource-definition">Resource definition</h2>

<p>A Resource represents an external entity that will be related with a Vocabulary. The most common resources used when creating relationships with vocabulary are <em>datasets</em>, <em>layers</em> and <em>widgets</em>.</p>

<h2 id="tags-definition">Tags definition</h2>

<p>A Tag is a way to categorize a resource within a vocabulary context.</p>

<h2 id="vocabulary-definition">Vocabulary definition</h2>

<p>The Vocabulary can be described as a cluster of tags.</p>

<p>It is currently possible to just create a Vocabulary without any tags or relationships.
To do it, the only parameter that is required is the name of the Vocabulary.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th style="text-align: center">Description</th>
<th style="text-align: right">Type</th>

<td style="text-align: right">String</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>However, the most common use case relies on the relationships creation.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>This section describes how to associate an existing or new Vocabulary to a resource.</p>

<p>Some important points:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>Vocabulary</strong> can have <strong>N</strong> associated <strong>Resources</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>Resource</strong> can have <strong>M</strong> associated <strong>Vocabularies</strong>.</li>
<li>The way of building these <strong>relationships</strong> is creating <strong>Tags</strong>.</li>

<p>To create a relationship between a Resource and a Vocabulary (even if the Vocabulary or the Resource doesn&rsquo;t exist yet) it is only required that you set the tags that define the relationship.</p>

<p>Some writing operations can take a little more time than reading ones. Even if the relationships are not strong, the writing operations have to ensure consistency along entities.</p>

<p>Remember that you can create relationshipts between Vocabulary and datasets, widgets or layers (the supported Resources).</p>

<aside class="notice">
Please, be sure that the request is properly authenticated and the current user has permission to the resource.
If you don&rsquo;t know how to do this, please go to the <a href="#authentication">Authentication section</a>

<h2 id="what-is-geostore">What is Geostore</h2>

<p>If you are new to the RW API, or want to learn more about the concept of a geostore, we strongly encourage you to read the <a href="#geostore">geostore concept</a> documentation first. It gives you a brief and clear description of what a geostore is, and what it can do for you.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve read that section, you can come back here to learn more details about using the RW API Geostore feature, which aims to provide a comprehensive way to communicate geographic vector-data structures described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a> between platforms and microservices.</p>

<p><a href="index-rw.html#what-are-geostore-objects">Geostore objects</a>, describing things like the boundaries of countries, protected areas or land use types, have been uploaded by <a href="https://www.wri.org/">WRI</a>, its partner organizations, or by API users like you. They are particularly useful for combining with the range of <a href="#dataset">datasets</a> available in the RW API, for example to create national summaries or for making a specific analysis within your own user-defined region.</p>

<p>To find out more about accessing the geostore objects already available on the RW API, check out the documentation on <a href="#getting-geostore-objects">getting geostore objects</a>. A quick, visual way to view an existing geostore is by using the <a href="#get-geostore-by-geostore-id-and-view-at-geojson-io"><code class="prettyprint">/geostore/:id/view</code></a> endpoint.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="#create-a-geostore-object">create you own geostore objects</a> on the RW API, if you&rsquo;d like to share your data with the world, or if you are looking to use the RW API and its features to gain insights into your data.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-geostore-objects">What are Geostore objects</h2>

<p>Geostore objects contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a> <code class="prettyprint">FeatureCollection</code> objects (<code class="prettyprint">geojson</code>), with a single <code class="prettyprint">Feature</code> whose <code class="prettyprint">Geometry</code> has been checked for geometric validity, and have been assigned an identifier (<code class="prettyprint">id</code>, <code class="prettyprint">hash</code>) upon creation.</p>

<p>This identifier is a 128-bit hash generated by passing the <a href="#geostore">pre-processed GeoJSON string</a> through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 message-digest algorithm</a>. This means that each identifier is a unique fingerprint of the GeoJSON string.</p>

<p>If you add an exact copy of your GeoJSON string, it will generate the same hash. But if any GeoJSON property is changed in any way, the generated hash will be different. Hence, the Geostore identifier provides the RW API a way to ensure that platforms and microservices are using <em>exactly</em> the same geographic structures. This also means that Geostore objects are static and cannot be modified.</p>

<p>To prevent overwriting of existing geostore objects, they contain a field indicated if the object is locked to editing (<code class="prettyprint">lock</code>); which can be <a href="#create-a-geostore-object">set when creating geostore objects</a>.</p>

<p>Also, during object creation the minimum bounding box enclosing all geometries in the GeoJSON (<code class="prettyprint">bbox</code>), and, if the geometries are type (Multi) Polygon, total surface area in hectares of the geometries (<code class="prettyprint">areaHa</code>) are added to the geostore. <em>Note these values are not calculated if supplied when creating a geostore.</em></p>

<p>Geostore objects can also be <a href="#create-using-a-provider-definition">created by getting a GeoJSON from provider API</a>; in which case the geostore will also include an object which gives information used to connect to the provider data source (<code class="prettyprint">provider</code>). At present the only provider definition supported is a <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> table, using  <code class="prettyprint">&quot;type&quot;: &quot;carto&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, all geostore objects have a property for storing application specific attributes (<code class="prettyprint">info</code>), which has no formalized schema. Here, fields used for indexing, and metadata, related to use on different platforms are added.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-available-endpoints">Overview of available endpoints</h2>

<p>The Geostore API consists of a number of endpoints to help users interact with geostore objects. Many of them are essentially helpers to make it easy to access geometries from useful data sources, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative areas</strong> (countries, regions, ect.) from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADM">Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Protected areas</strong> (world heritage sites, national parks, ect.) from the <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas">The World Database on Protected Areas</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Land activity/use types</strong> (logging, mining, ect.) from the <a href="https://www.wri.org/">WRI</a> <a href="https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/managed-forest-concessions">managed forest</a>, <a href="https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/mining-concessions">mining</a>, and <a href="https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/20398d4dc36e47bd92b559786670f270_1">oil palm</a> concessions, and <a href="https://wwf.panda.org">WWF</a>/<a href="https://www.resolve.ngo/about.htm">RESOLVE</a> <a href="https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/tiger-conservation-landscapes">tiger conservation</a> datasets.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>As these data sets are periodically updated, these &ldquo;helper&rdquo; endpoints are updated to use the latest data. So unless you really need an older version of a data set, such as GADM, you should always use the latest endpoint version. See the table below to get an overview of what can be done; click on the description to get more details.</p>

<p>Geostore objects can be created via the POST <code class="prettyprint">geostore</code> endpoint, which accepts as body a provider definition object (<code class="prettyprint">&lt;provider&gt;</code>), the API then fetches a GeoJSON from the provider, and adds it to the Geostore. If the object is correctly added to the Geostore a <code class="prettyprint">200</code> response is returned, as well as the new geostore object. At present the only provider definition supported is a <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> table, using <code class="prettyprint">&quot;type&quot;: &quot;carto&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>If the specified <code class="prettyprint">table</code>, <code class="prettyprint">user</code>, or <code class="prettyprint">filter</code> is not recognized a <code class="prettyprint">400</code> response is returned with the error message &ldquo;Geojson not found&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="getting-geostore-objects">Getting geostore objects</h2>

<p>The fundamental way to read geometries from the RW APIs Geostore is by using Geostore ids. Using these identifiers you can ensure that you are always <a href="#geostore-objects">retrieving exactly the same <code class="prettyprint">Feature</code></a>. If you <a href="#create-a-geostore-object">add your own geostore objects</a> you will be using <a href="#get-geostore-by-geostore-id">these endpoints</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you may prefer to get selected geometries from the datasets already added to the RW API Geostore, such as the <a href="#overview-of-available-endpoints">latest administrative areas, protected areas, or land use types</a>. Note, these are periodically updated, and potentially both geometries and ids may change between versions. By design this means that, for example, the Geostore ids of countries change between versions. These geometries can also be simplified when reading them from the Geostore, using the parameter <code class="prettyprint">?simplify=&lt;value&gt;</code>, where <code class="prettyprint">&lt;value&gt;</code> is given to the simplification algorithm - <code class="prettyprint">0.005</code> usually works well.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-geostore-object-by-geostore-id">Get a geostore object by Geostore id</h3>

<p>Geostore objects can be retrieved via the GET <code class="prettyprint">geostore/:id</code> endpoint, which returns a single object selected from the Geostore using a single <a href="#geostore">Geostore id</a> (<code class="prettyprint">&lt;id&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>The returned geometries can be simplified using the parameter <code class="prettyprint">?simplify=&lt;value&gt;</code>. Where <code class="prettyprint">&lt;value&gt;</code> is given to the simplification algorithm- 0.005 usually works well.</p>

<p><em>Note - each of the land use types actually represents an individual dataset, each with different geographical extents and temporal coverage, see the <a href="#overview-of-available-endpoints">dataset urls</a> for details</em>  </p>

<p>Multiple sorting criteria can be used, separating them by commas.</p>

<p>You can specify the sorting order by prepending the criteria with either <code class="prettyprint">-</code> for descending order or <code class="prettyprint">+</code> for ascending order. By default, ascending order is assumed.</p>

<p>The API currently supports sorting by means of the <code class="prettyprint">sort</code> parameter. Sorting can be done using any field from the dashboard, as well as <code class="prettyprint">user.name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">user.role</code> (sorting by user data is restricted to ADMIN users).</p>

<p>Sorting by nested fields is not supported at the moment.</p>

<p>When loading dashboards, you can optionally pass an <code class="prettyprint">includes</code> query argument to load additional data.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-subscription">What is a subscription?</h2>

<p><em>Note: We strongly recommend that you read the <a href="#dataset">dataset concept</a> and <a href="#dataset6">dataset endpoints</a> sections before proceeding.</em></p>

<p>A subscription allows you to get notified of updates on a datasets&rsquo; data - either for every update, or for updates restricted to geographical areas of your interest. For example, you can use subscriptions to subscribe to deforestation alerts (<a href="http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/61170ad0-9d6a-4347-8e58-9b551eeb341e">GLAD alerts dataset</a>) in the Amazon forest, or track fire alerts (<a href="http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/64c948a6-5e34-4ef2-bb69-6a6535967bd5">VIIRS fire alerts dataset</a>) in your area of residence.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will cover how you can interact and manage subscriptions in the RW API. We will see how you can customize subscriptions so that we only get notified for changes in a dataset&rsquo;s data for specific geographic regions. You will learn how to use them to get notified via email or calls to a URL you provide. We will also dive into subscription lifecycle, and understand how we can confirm subscriptions, resend confirmation emails and how to unsubscribe and stop receiving notifications.</p>

<h2 id="subscription-lifecycle">Subscription lifecycle</h2>

<p>In this section, you will learn about the lifecycle of a subscription. This will help you understand how you can best use subscriptions to meet your goals. The first step for using subscriptions is understanding which data you want to subscribe - for this, we recommend <a href="index-rw.html#getting-all-datasets">searching the existing datasets</a> in the WRI API (or maybe even <a href="index-rw.html#creating-a-dataset">creating a new one</a>). Once you are certain of the dataset you wish to subscribe, the next step is ensuring that this dataset is subscribable.</p>

<p>While you can create a subscription for <em>any</em> dataset, some conditions must be met by the dataset for its corresponding subscriptions to be functional and actually work as described here.</p>

<p>In order to support a functional subscription, a dataset must have some queries defined in its <code class="prettyprint">subscribable</code> property. In this property, of type object, one (or many) sub-objects should be declared. Please note that you can define multiple keys in the <code class="prettyprint">subscribable</code> object, and each key will be evaluated separately and trigger its own updates. Each object inside the <code class="prettyprint">subscribable</code> property must define two queries:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">dataQuery</code>, which will be evaluated as the subscription&rsquo;s content - i.e. this is what has been updated since the last check on the updates of this dataset.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">subscriptionQuery</code>, which will be evaluated to check if a subscription has changed since the last update. This query should return a single row with the count of updated items since the last update check. If the value returned by this query is greater than 0, then all the subscriptions that reference this dataset will receive a notification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The example on the side defines the <code class="prettyprint">subscribable</code> object for an example dataset, and this object contains a the key <code class="prettyprint">test</code>, including both a <code class="prettyprint">dataQuery</code> and a <code class="prettyprint">subscriptionQuery</code>. For more details on how you can modify the <code class="prettyprint">subscribable</code> property of a dataset, check out the documentation on <a href="#updating-a-dataset">updating a dataset</a>. The keys in the subscribable object (e.g. <code class="prettyprint">test</code>) are just for organizational purposes, and they won&rsquo;t be used in any way from the subscription&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<p>Both queries can contain two special keywords: <code class="prettyprint">{begin}</code> and <code class="prettyprint">{end}</code>. These will be replaced with ISO-formatted dates on runtime, with the datetime in which the subscription was last evaluated, and the datetime at the time of evaluation, respectively.</p>

<p><em>Please note that, for readability purposes, the special characters in example on the side are not properly escaped. Don&rsquo;t forget all special characters must be properly escaped for the queries to be correctly executed.</em></p>

<h3 id="creating-and-confirming-the-subscription">Creating and confirming the subscription</h3>

<p>You have your dataset ready to be subscribed. The next steps would be to actually create the subscription - check the <a href="#creating-a-subscription">docs for creating subscriptions</a> for detailed information on how to do that.</p>

<p>After creating the subscription, an email is sent with a confirmation link. You need to click this link in order to confirm the notification and start receiving notifications. You can check if the subscription is confirmed or not by looking at the <code class="prettyprint">confirmed</code> field of the subscription object. Check more information about confirming subscriptions in the <a href="#confirming-a-subscription">confirming a subscription</a> section.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you have lost the confirmation email, you can check the <a href="#resending-the-subscription-confirmation-email">resending confirmation emails</a> section for more information on how to resend the confirmation email.</p>

<p>At any point, you might want to stop receiving email or webhook notifications - if that is the case, you can check the <a href="#unsubscribing">unsubscribing</a> section for details on how to stop receiving notifications for your subscriptions.</p>

<p>The same subscription can subscribe to multiple datasets - for that, you just need to provide all the dataset ids you intend to subscribe in either the <code class="prettyprint">datasets</code> or <code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code> fields of the subscription on creation. However, a subscription can only notify a single email at a time - if you intend to receive subscription notifications on multiple emails, you&rsquo;ll need to create multiple subscriptions.</p>

<p>Subscriptions support two types of notifications: emails or webhook requests is performed. Both notifications are checked and sent every day, assuming that the dataset data has changed since the last notification sent.</p>

<p>Webhook notifications are sent as POST requests to the URL saved in the subscription. You can check on the side an example of the data that is sent in the body of the POST call. Please note that the webhook POST body data can change, based on the dataset chosen to receive notifications.</p>

<p>You can see in the image below an example of an email notification for GLAD deforestation alerts:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, you should know which dataset to use and when its data gets updated.</li>
<li>You ensure that the dataset is subscribable - if not, you should write the subscription queries and update the dataset.</li>
<li>You create a subscription.</li>
<li>You get a confirmation email and click on the link to confirm the subscription.</li>
<li>Done! You will now get an email every day with the updates to the dataset data <em>(note that if there are no updates, no email is sent)</em>.</li>
<li>Later, you can unsubscribe or delete the subscription.</li>

<p>This endpoint will allow you to get all the subscriptions owned by the user who performed the request (identified by the access token). To use this endpoint, you must be logged in (i.e. a token must be provided). In the sections below, we’ll explore how you can customize this endpoint call to match your needs.</p>

<p>For a detailed description of each field, check out the <a href="#subscription-reference">Subscription reference</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="filters">Filters</h3>

<p>This section will guide you through the process of creating a basic subscription in the RW API. Creating a subscription can be done by any logged user using a POST request and passing the relevant data as body fields. The supported body fields are as defined on the <a href="#subscription-reference">subscription reference</a> section, but the minimum field list you must specify for all subscriptions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">datasets</code> or <code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">resource</code> (which must include both <code class="prettyprint">resource.type</code> and <code class="prettyprint">resource.content</code>)</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">params</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">application</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">language</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the creation of the subscription is successful, the HTTP response code will be 200 OK, and the response body will contain the created subscription object. Please note that <strong>subscriptions must be confirmed</strong> before they become active - refer to the <a href="#subscription-lifecycle">subscription lifecycle</a> for more details on this.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-datasets">Defining the datasets</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the dataset ids to which your subscription will watch for updates. In order to do so, you&rsquo;ll need to provide one of two fields when creating a subscription:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">datasets</code> - this field is a simple array of dataset ids. Each dataset will be individually evaluated for updates, and it will trigger an email if the <code class="prettyprint">subscriptionsQuery</code> returns greater than 0.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code> is an alternative way of defining the datasets to subscribe: using this field, you have the advantage of being able to define a different threshold for sending the email (i.e. the email is sent if the <code class="prettyprint">subscriptionQuery</code> returns a count greater than the threshold defined in the <code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code> object). For more details on the structure of the objects inside <code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code>, please check the <a href="index-rw.html#subscription-reference">subscription model reference</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customizing-the-geographic-area-for-the-subscription">Customizing the geographic area for the subscription</h3>

<p>When it comes to geo-referenced data, subscriptions are intrinsically tied to a geographic area of interest. This association enables users to create subscriptions to be notified of changes in the data of a dataset, but only if there are changes in the data of the dataset relative to the concrete geographic area of the world they are interested in. The specification of the geographic information for the subscription should be done in the <code class="prettyprint">params</code> field of the subscription.</p>

<p>A subscription can refer to a land use area provided by different datasets. At this point, the following land use datasets are supported: <code class="prettyprint">mining</code> for mining areas, <code class="prettyprint">logging</code> for Congo Basin logging roads, <code class="prettyprint">oilpalm</code> for palm oil plantations or <code class="prettyprint">fiber</code> for wood fiber plantations. If this is the case, you should provide the name of the land use dataset you wish to use in the <code class="prettyprint">params.use</code> field, and the id of the area in the <code class="prettyprint">params.useid</code> field of the request body when creating the subscription.</p>

<p>The ids to be used for land use areas can be obtained from the following CartoDB datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mining area IDs can be obtained by querying <a href="http://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/c2142922-84d9-4564-8216-a4867b9e48c5">this dataset</a>.</li>

<p>You can update subscriptions associated with you user account by using the PATCH <code class="prettyprint">v1/subscriptions/:id</code> endpoint. Updating a subscription follows the same validations as when creating a new one - i.e. all required field values must be provided, even if they remain the same. Values for fields other than the following are optional. The minimum fields list you must specify to update a subscription is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">datasets</code> or <code class="prettyprint">datasetsQuery</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">resource</code> (which much include <code class="prettyprint">resource.type</code> and <code class="prettyprint">resource.content</code>)</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">params</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">application</code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">language</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the update of the subscription is successful, the HTTP response code will be 200 OK, and the response body will contain the updated subscription object.</p>

<p><em>Note: Updating a subscription does not require confirming it. A confirmed subscription will stay confirmed after an update.</em></p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X GET <span class="s2">"https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/subscriptions/&lt;subscription_id&gt;/confirm"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Upon creation of the subscription, a confirmation email is sent to the email of the user who created the subscription. This email will contain a link, which you will need to click in order to confirm the subscription. You can also confirm the subscription by performing a GET request to the <code class="prettyprint">v1/subscriptions/:id/confirm</code> endpoint, as exemplified on the side.</p>

<p><em>Manually calling this endpoint will redirect you to the GFW application.</em></p>

<h2 id="resending-the-subscription-confirmation-email">Resending the subscription confirmation email</h2>

</code></pre>
<p>For convenience, the RW API offers an additional endpoint to resend the confirmation email. In order to do this, you should perform a GET request to the <code class="prettyprint">v1/subscriptions/:id/send_confirmation</code>. As with most of the other subscription endpoints, please keep in mind that you must be authenticated in order to use this endpoint.</p>

<p>This endpoint does not change the subscription - i.e. if the subscription was already confirmed, it stays that way. The confirmation email will always be sent, regardless if the subscription is confirmed or not.</p>

<p><em>Manually calling this endpoint will redirect you to the GFW application.</em></p>

<p>A task is fundamentally an internal element to the API, and it&rsquo;s visibility and interaction is limited to maintenance and debug actions.
At its core, a task represents a single package that contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>An action to be carried out.</li>
<li>A message that parametrises that action.</li>
<li>A status that identifies the progress stage of the task.</li>
<li>A dataset to which that action should relate.</li>
<li>An Elasticsearch index identifier where the resulting data will be saved.</li>
<li>Counters for read and write operations.</li>
<li>Logs for those operations.</li>
<li>An optional error field that identifies what happened in case of failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="delete-microservice">Delete microservice</h2>

<p>To remove a microservice:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl -X DELETE https://api.resourcewatch.org/api/v1/microservice/:id <span class="se">\</span>
-H <span class="s2">"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your-token&gt;"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will delete the microservice and its associated endpoints from the gateway&rsquo;s database. It does not remove the actual running microservice application instance, which may re-register and become available once again.</p>

          <h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>This section is meant to help you deal with common pitfalls of everyday usage of the API.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and authorization</h2>

<h3 id="401-unauthorized">401 Unauthorized</h3>

<p><code class="prettyprint">401 Unauthorized</code> errors mean that the API did not receive the necessary data to identify who you are. You may not be logged in, there may be an issue with your usage of the user token, or the token you are using may be in the wrong header.</p>

<p>Start by following the steps <a href="#how-to-generate-your-private-token">detailed here for obtaining your private token</a>. At the end you should have your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JWT token</a>, a large string of random-looking characters.</p>

<p>If you are sure you have an up-to-date token but are still experiencing <code class="prettyprint">401 Unauthorized</code> errors, there may be an issue with the way the token is transmitted to the API. Be sure to use in <code class="prettyprint">Authorization</code> header and <code class="prettyprint">Bearer &lt;your token goes here&gt;</code> value.</p>

<h3 id="403-forbidden">403 Forbidden</h3>

<p>A <code class="prettyprint">403 Forbidden</code> error means that you are identified as a valid user, but you do not have the required permissions for the action you are trying to perform. Common scenarios where this happens are:
- You do not have the required user <code class="prettyprint">ROLE</code> to carry out that operation.
- You may be trying to operate on a resource that belongs to a different <code class="prettyprint">application</code> than the ones you are associated with. Read more about how the <code class="prettyprint">application</code> field works <a href="index-rw.html#applications">here</a>.
- Certain resources have a concept of <code class="prettyprint">owner</code> with certain actions being exclusively available to that particular user.</p>

<p>Check the specific documentation for the endpoint you are trying to use for more details on its behavior. Conditions that trigger a <code class="prettyprint">403 Forbidden</code> error will often vary beyond the ones listed above.</p>
